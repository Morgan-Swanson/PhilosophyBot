<h2 id="Intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Despite its status as a core part of contemporary physics, there is no
consensus among physicists or philosophers of physics on the question
of what, if anything, the empirical success of quantum theory is
telling us about the physical world. This gives rise to the collection
of philosophical issues known as &ldquo;the interpretation of quantum
mechanics&rdquo;. One should not be misled by this terminology into
thinking that what we have is an uninterpreted mathematical formalism
with no connection to the physical world. Rather, there is a common
core of interpretation that consists of recipes for calculating
probabilities of outcomes of experiments performed on systems
subjected to certain state preparation procedures. What are often
referred to as different &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; of quantum
mechanics differ on what, if anything, is added to the common core.
Arguably, two of the major approaches, hidden-variables theories and
collapse theories, involve formulation of physical theories distinct
from standard quantum mechanics; this renders the terminology of
&ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; even more inappropriate. </p>

<p>
Much of the philosophical literature connected with quantum theory
centers on the problem of whether we should construe the theory, or a
suitable extension or revision of it, in realist terms, and, if so,
how this should be done. Various approaches to the &ldquo;Measurement
Problem&rdquo; propose differing answers to these questions. There
are, however, other questions of philosophical interest. These include
the bearing of quantum nonlocality on our understanding of spacetime
structure and causality, the question of the ontological character of
quantum states, the implications of quantum mechanics for information
theory, and the task of situating quantum theory with respect to other
theories, both actual and hypothetical. In what follows, we will touch
on each of these topics, with the main goal being to provide an entry
into the relevant literature, including the Stanford Encyclopedia
entries on these topics.</p>

<h2 id="QuanTheo">2. Quantum Theory</h2>

<p>
In this section we present a brief introduction to quantum theory; see
the entry on 
 <a href="../qm/">quantum mechanics</a>
 for a more detailed introduction.</p>

<h3 id="QuanStatClasStat">2.1 Quantum states and classical states</h3>

<p>
In classical physics, with any physical system is associated a state
space, which represents the totality of possible ways of assigning
values to the dynamical variables that characterize the state of the
system. For example, for a system consisting of \(n\) point particles,
the state of the system is given by specifying the positions and
momenta of all of the particles with respect to some reference frame.
For systems of a great many degrees of freedom, a complete
specification of the state of the system may be unavailable or
unwieldy; classical statistical mechanics deals with such a situation
by invoking a probability distribution over the state space of the
system. A probability distribution that assigns any probability other
than one or zero to some physical quantities is regarded as an
incomplete specification of the state of the system. </p>

<p>
In quantum mechanics, things are different. There are no quantum
states that assign definite values to all physical quantities, and
probabilities are built into the standard formulation of the theory.
Construction of a quantum theory of some physical system proceeds by
first associating the dynamical degrees of freedom with operators on
an appropriately constructed Hilbert space (see the entry on
 <a href="../qm/">quantum mechanics</a> for details). 
A state can be characterized by an assignment of expectation values to
physical quantities (&ldquo;observables&rdquo;).  These assignments
are required to be <em>linear</em>. That is, if one physical quantity
is a linear combination of others, the corresponding expectation
values stand in the same relation. A complete set of such expectation
values is equivalent to a specification of probabilities for outcomes
of all experiments that could be performed on the system. Two
physical quantities are said to be <em>compatible</em> if there is a
single experiment that yields values for them both; these are
associated with operators that commute, that is, operators \(A\),
\(B\) such that \(AB = BA\). Incompatible observables give rise to
uncertainty relations; see the entry on
 <a href="../qt-uncertainty/">the uncertainty principle</a>.</p>
 

<p>
A pure state, that is, a maximally specific assignment of expectation
values, may be represented in a number of physically equivalent ways, for
instance by a vector in the Hilbert space or a projection operator
onto a one-dimensional subspace. In addition to pure states, one can
also consider non-pure states, called <em>mixed</em>; these are
represented by operators called <em>density operators</em>. If a pure
state assigns a definite value to a physical quantity, a vector that
represents the state will be an eigenvector of the corresponding
operator. This gives rise to what has been called the
&ldquo;eigenstate-eigenvalue link&rdquo;, that is, the interpretative
principle that, <em>if</em> a system is assigned a state vector that
is an eigenvector of some operator representing a physical quantity,
then the corresponding dynamical quantity has the corresponding value,
and this can be regarded as a property of the physical system.</p>

<p>
The noncontroversial core of quantum theory consists of rules for
identifying, for any given system, the appropriate operators
representing its dynamical quantities, and an appropriate Hilbert
space for these operators to act on. In addition, there are
prescriptions for evolving the state of system when it is acted upon
by specified external fields or subjected to various manipulations
(see
 <a href="#QuanStatEvol">section 1.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Whether we can or can expect to be able to go beyond this
noncontroversial core, and take the theory to be more than a means for
calculating probabilities of outcomes of experiments, is an issue that
remains a topic of contemporary philosophical discussion.</p>

<h3 id="QuanMechQuanFielTheo">2.2 Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</h3>

<p>
<em>Quantum mechanics</em> is usually taken to refer to the quantized
version of a theory of classical mechanics, involving systems with a
fixed, finite number of degrees of freedom. Classically, a field, such
as, for example, an electromagnetic field, is a system endowed with
infinitely many degrees of freedom. Quantization of a field theory
gives rise to a <em>quantum field theory</em>. The chief philosophical
issues raised by quantum mechanics remain when the transition is made
to a quantum field theory; in addition, new interpretational issues
arise. There are interesting differences, both technical and
interpretational, between quantum mechanical theories and quantum
field theories; for an overview, see the entries on
 <a href="../quantum-field-theory/">quantum field theory</a>
 and
 <a href="../qt-nvd/">quantum theory: von Neumann vs. Dirac</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The standard model of quantum field theory, successful as it is, does
not yet incorporate gravitation. The attempt to develop a theory that
does justice both the quantum phenomena and to gravitational phenomena
gives rise to serious conceptual issues (see the entry on
 <a href="../quantum-gravity/">quantum gravity</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="QuanStatEvol">2.3 Quantum state evolution</h3>

<h4>2.3.1. The Schr&ouml;dinger equation</h4>

<p>
The equation of motion obeyed by a quantum state vector is the
<em>Schr&ouml;dinger equation.</em> It is constructed by first forming
the operator \(H\) corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the system,
which represents the total energy of the system. The rate of change of
a state vector is proportional to the result of operating on the
vector with the Hamiltonian operator \(H\).</p> 

\[
i \hbar {\,\D}/{\D t}\, \ket{\psi (t)}  = H \ket{\psi (t)}.
\]

<p>
There is an operator that takes a state at time 0 into a state at time
\(t\); it is given by</p> 

\[
U(t) = \exp\left(\frac{{-}i H t}{\hbar}\right).
\]

<p>
This operator is a linear operator that implements a one-one mapping
of the Hilbert space to itself that preserves the inner product of any
two vectors; operators with these properties are called <em>unitary
operators</em>, and, for this reason, evolution according to the
Schr&ouml;dinger equation is called <em>unitary evolution.</em></p>

<p>
For our purposes, the most important features of this equation is that
it is <em>deterministic</em> and <em>linear</em>. The state vector at
any time, together with the equation, uniquely determines the state
vector at any other time. Linearity means that, if two vectors
\(\ket{\psi_1(0)}\) and \(\ket{\psi_2(0)}\) evolve into vectors
\(\ket{\psi_1(t) }\) and \(\ket{\psi_2(t)}\), respectively, then, if
the state at time 0 is a linear combination of these two, the state at
any time \(t\) will be the corresponding linear combination of
\(\ket{\psi_1(t)}\) and \(\ket{\psi_2(t)}\).</p> 

\[
a\ket{\psi_{1}(0)}  + b\ket{\psi_{2}(0)}  \rightarrow  a\ket{\psi_{1}(t)}  + b\ket{\psi_{2}(t)} . 
\]

<h4>2.3.2. The collapse postulate</h4>

<p>
Textbook formulations of quantum mechanics usually include an
additional postulate about how to assign a state vector after an
experiment. This has its origins in von Neumann&rsquo;s distinction
between two types of processes: Process 1, which occurs upon
performance of an experiment, and Process 2, the unitary evolution
that takes place as long as no experiment is made (see von Neumann
1932, 1955: &sect;V.1). In Dirac&rsquo;s formulation, the postulate
is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we measure a real dynamical variable \(\xi\), the disturbance
involved in the act of measurement causes a jump in the state of the
dynamical system. From physical continuity, if we make a second
measurement of the same dynamical variable \(\xi\) immediately after
the first, the result of the second measurement must be the same as
that of the first. Thus after the first measurement has been made,
there is no indeterminacy in the result of the second. Hence, after
the first measurement has been made, the system is in an eigenstate of
the dynamical variable \(\xi\), the eigenvalue it belongs to being
equal to the result of the first measurement. This conclusion must
still hold if the second measurement is not actually made. In this way
we see that a measurement always causes the system to jump into an
eigenstate of the dynamical variable that is being measured, the
eigenvalue this eigenstate belongs to being equal to the result of the
measurement (Dirac 1935: 36).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dirac&rsquo;s &ldquo;jump&rdquo; has come to be known as <em>state
vector collapse</em> or <em>wave-function collapse</em>, and the
postulation of a jump of this sort is called the <em>collapse
postulate</em>, or <em>projection postulate</em>.</p>

<p>
If the quantum state vector is thought to represent only a state of
belief or knowledge about a physical system, and not the physical
state of the system, then one could regard an abrupt shift in the
state vector upon measurement as a shift corresponding to
incorporating the result of the measurement into one&rsquo;s belief
state. Neither von Neumann nor Dirac, however, seem to think of it
this way; it is treated by both as a physical process. Note, also,
that Dirac expresses the postulate in terms of
&ldquo;measurement&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;observation&rdquo;;
there is no suggestion that a conscious observer must become aware of
the result of the measurement in order for a collapse to occur.
Though, in his extended discussion of the measurement process, von
Neumann (1932, 1955, Ch. VI) does discuss the act of observation, he
emphasizes that the collapse postulate may be applied to interactions
with quantum systems with measuring apparatus, before an observer is
aware of the result. A formulation of a version of the collapse
postulate according to which a measurement is not completed until the
result is observed is found in London and Bauer (1939). They deny,
however, that it represents a mysterious kind of interaction between
the observer and the quantum system; for them, the replacement of the
pre-observation state vector with a new one is a matter of the
observer acquiring new information. These two interpretations of the
collapse postulate, as either a real change of the physical state of
the system, or as a mere updating of information on the part of an
observer, have persisted in the literature.</p>

<p>
If state vector collapse is to be regarded as a physical process, this
raises the question of what <em>physically</em> distinguishes
interventions that are to count as &ldquo;measurements&rdquo;, capable
of inducing an abrupt jump in the state of the system, from other
interventions, which induce only continuous, unitary evolution. As
John S. Bell (1990) has argued, &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; is not an
appropriate concept to appear in the formulation of any physical
theory that might be taken to be fundamental. If, however, one
dispenses with the postulate, this gives rise to the so-called
&ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo;, which we will discuss after we have
introduced the notion of entanglement (see
 <a href="#MeasProb">section 3</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="EntaNonlNons">3. Entanglement, nonlocality, and nonseparability</h2>

<p>
Given two disjoint physical systems, \(A\) and \(B\), with which we
associate Hilbert spaces \(H_{A}\) and \(H_{B}\), the Hilbert space
associated with the composite system is the tensor product space,
denoted \(H_{A} \otimes H_{B}\).</p>

<p>
When the two systems are independently prepared in pure states
\(\ket{\psi}\) and \(\ket{\phi}\), the state of the composite system
is the <em>product state</em> \(\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}\)
(sometimes written with the cross, \(\otimes\), omitted).</p>

<p>
In addition to the product states, the tensor product space contains
linear combinations of product states, that is, state vectors of the
form</p> 

\[
a\ket{\psi_{1}} \otimes \ket{\phi_{1}}  + b\ket{\psi_{2}} \otimes \ket{\phi_{2}}
\]

<p>
The tensor product space can be defined as the smallest Hilbert space
containing all of the product states. Any pure state represented by a
state vector that is not a product vector is an <em>entangled
state</em>.</p>

<p>
The state of the composite system assigns probabilities to outcomes of
all experiments that can be performed on the composite system. We can
also consider a restriction to experiments performed on system \(A\),
or a restriction to experiments performed to \(B\). Such restrictions
yields states of \(A\) and \(B\), respectively, called the <em>reduced
states</em> of the systems. When the state of the composite system
\(AB\) is an entangled state, then the reduced states of \(A\) and
\(B\) are mixed states. To see this, suppose that in the above state
the vectors \(\ket{\phi_{1}}\) and \(\ket{\phi_{2}}\) represent
distinguishable states. If one confines one&rsquo;s attention to
experiments performed on \(A\), it makes no difference whether an
experiment is also performed on \(B\). An experiment performed on
\(B\) that distinguishes \(\ket{\phi_{1}}\) and \(\ket{\phi_{2}}\)
projects the state of \(A\) into either \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) or
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\), with probabilities \(\abs{a}^{2}\) and
\(\abs{b}^{2}\), respectively, and probabilities for outcomes of
experiments performed on \(A\) are the corresponding averages of
probabilities for states \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) and \(\ket{\psi_{2}}\).
These probabilities, as mentioned, are the same as those for the
situation in which no experiment is performed on \(B\). Thus, even if
no experiment is performed on \(B\), the probabilities of outcomes of
experiments on \(A\) are exactly as if system \(A\) is either in the
state represented by \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) or the state represented by
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\), with probabilities \(\abs{a}^{2}\) and
\(\abs{b}^{2}\), respectively.</p>

<p>
In general, any state, pure or mixed, that is neither a product state
nor a mixture of product states, is called an <em>entangled
state.</em></p>

<p>
The existence of pure entangled states means that, if we consider a
composite system consisting of spatially separated parts, then, even
when the state of the system is a pure state, the state is not
determined by the reduced states of its component parts. Thus, quantum
states exhibit a form of <em>nonseparability</em>. See the entry on 
 <a href="../physics-holism/">holism and nonseparability in physics</a>
 for more information.</p>

<p>
Quantum entanglement results in a form of nonlocality that is alien to
classical physics. Even if we assume that the reduced states of \(A\)
and \(B\) do not completely characterize their physical states, but
must be supplemented by some further variables, there are quantum
correlations that cannot be reduced to correlations between states of
\(A\) and \(B\); see the entries on
 <a href="../bell-theorem/">Bell&rsquo;s Theorem</a>
 and
 <a href="../qm-action-distance/">action at a distance in quantum mechanics</a>.</p>

If quantum theory is meant to be (in principle) a universal theory, it
should be applicable, in principle, to all physical systems, including
systems as large and complicated as our experimental apparatus.
Consider, now, a schematized experiment. Suppose we have a quantum
system that can be prepared in at least two distinguishable states,
\(\ket{0} _{S}\) and \(\ket{1} _{S}\). Let \(\ket{R} _{A}\) be a ready
state of the apparatus, that is, a state in which the apparatus is
ready to make a measurement.</p>

<p>
If the apparatus is working properly, and if the measurement is a
minimally disturbing one, the coupling of the system \(S\) with the
apparatus \(A\) should result in an evolution that predictably yields
results of the form</p> 

\[
\ket{0} _{S} \ket{R}  _{A} \Rightarrow  \ket{0}  _{S}\ket{&ldquo;0&rdquo; }  _{A}
\]

 

\[
\ket{1} _{S} \ket{R}  _{A} \Rightarrow  \ket{1}  _{S}\ket{&ldquo;1&rdquo;} _{A}
\]

<p>
where \(\ket{&ldquo;0&rdquo; } _{A}\) and \(\ket{&ldquo;1&rdquo;}
_{A}\) are apparatus states indicating results 0 and 1,
respectively.</p>

<p>
Now suppose that the system \(S\) is prepared in a superposition of
the states \(\ket{0} _{S}\) and \(\ket{1}_{S}\).</p> 

\[
\ket{\psi(0)} _{S} = a\ket{0} _{S} + b\ket{1} _{S},
\]

<p>
where \(a\) and \(b\) are both nonzero. If the evolution that leads
from the pre-experimental state to the post-experimental state is
linear Schr&ouml;dinger evolution, then we will have</p> 

\[
\ket{\psi(0)} _{S} \ket{R} _{A} \rightarrow  a\ket{0} _{S} \ket{&ldquo;0&rdquo; } _{A} + b\ket{1} _{S}\ket{&ldquo;1&rdquo; } _{A}.
\]

<p>
This is not an eigenstate of the instrument reading variable, but is,
rather, a state in which the reading variable and the system variable are
entangled with each other. The eigenstate-eigenvalue link, applied to
a state like this, does not yield a definite result for the instrument
reading. The problem of what to make of this is called the
&ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo; which is discussed in more detail
below.</p>

<h3 id="ApprMeasProb">4.2 Approaches to the measurement problem</h3>

<p>
If quantum state evolution proceeds via the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
or some other linear equation, then, as we have seen in the previous
section, typical experiments will lead to quantum states that are
superpositions of terms corresponding to distinct experimental
outcomes. It is sometimes said that this conflicts with our
experience, according to which experimental outcome variables, such as
pointer readings, always have definite values. This is a misleading
way of putting the issue, as it is not immediately clear how to
interpret states of this sort as physical states of a system that
includes experimental apparatus, and, if we can&rsquo;t say what it
would be like to observe the apparatus to be in such a state, it makes
no sense to say that we never observe it to be in a state like
that.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we are faced with an interpretational problem. If we take
the quantum state to be a complete description of the system, then the
state is, contrary to what would antecedently expect, not a state
corresponding to a unique, definite outcome. This is what led J.S.
Bell to remark, &ldquo;Either the wavefunction, as given by the
Schr&ouml;dinger equation, is not everything, or it is not
right&rdquo; (Bell 1987: 41, 2004: 201). This gives us a (<em>prima
facie</em>) tidy way of classifying approaches to the measurement
problem:</p>

<ol>

<li> There are approaches that involve a denial that a quantum wave
function (or any other way of representing a quantum state) yields a
complete description of a physical system.</li>

<li> There are approaches that involve modification of the dynamics to
produce a collapse of the wave function in appropriate
circumstances.</li>

<li> There are approaches that reject both horns of Bell&rsquo;s
dilemma, and hold that quantum states undergo unitary evolution at all
times and that a quantum state-description is, in principle,
complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We include in the first category approaches that deny that a quantum
state should be thought of as representing anything in reality at all.
These include variants of the Copenhagen interpretation, as well as
pragmatic and other anti-realist approaches. Also in the first
category are approaches that seek a completion of the quantum state
description. These include hidden-variables approaches and modal
interpretations. The second category of interpretation motivates a
research programme of finding suitable indeterministic modifications
of the quantum dynamics. Approaches that reject both horns of
Bell&rsquo;s dilemma are typified by Everettian, or
&ldquo;many-worlds&rdquo; interpretations.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 Non-realist approaches to quantum mechanics</h4>

<p>
From the early days of quantum mechanics, there has been a strain of
thought that holds that the proper attitude to take towards quantum
mechanics is an instrumentalist or pragmatic one. On such a view,
quantum mechanics is a tool for coordinating our experience and for
forming expectations about the outcomes of experiments. Variants of
this view include what has been called the Copenhagen Interpretation
(or Copenhagen Interpretations, as recent scholarship has emphasized
differences between figures associated with this view); see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-copenhagen/">Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>.
 More recently, views of this sort have been advocated by physicists,
including QBists, who hold that quantum states represent subjective or
epistemic probabilities (see Fuchs <em>et al.</em> 2014). The
philosopher Richard Healey defends a related view on which quantum
states, though objective, do not represent physical reality (see
Healey 2012; Healey forthcoming).</p>

<h4>4.2.2 Hidden-variables and modal interpretations</h4>

<p>
Theories whose structure include the quantum state but include
additional structure, with an aim of circumventing the measurement
problem, have traditionally been called &ldquo;hidden-variables
theories&rdquo;. That a quantum state description cannot be regarded
as a complete description of physical reality was argued for in a
famous paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) and by Einstein in
subsequent publications (Einstein 1936, 1948, 1949). See the entry on
 the <a href="../qt-epr/">Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument</a> 
in quantum theory. </p>

<p>
There are a number of theorems that circumscribe the scope of possible
hidden-variables theories. The most natural thought would be to seek a
theory that assigns to all quantum observables definite values that
are merely revealed upon measurement, in such a way that any
experimental procedure that, in conventional quantum mechanics, would
count as a &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; of an observable yields the
definite value assigned to the observable. Theories of this sort are
called <em>noncontextual</em> hidden-variables theory. It was shown by
Bell (1966) and Kochen and Specker (1967) that there are no such
theories for any system whose Hilbert space dimension is greater than
three (see the entry on
 <a href="../kochen-specker/">the Kochen-Specker theorem</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The Bell-Kochen-Specker Theorem does not rule out hidden-variables
theories <em>tout court</em>. The simplest way to circumvent it is to
pick as always-definite some observable or compatible set of
observables that suffices to guarantee determinate outcomes of
experiments; other observables are not assigned definite values and
experiments thought of as &ldquo;measurements&rdquo; of these
observables do not reveal pre-existing values.</p>

<p>
The most thoroughly worked-out theory of this type is the pilot wave
theory developed by de Broglie and presented by him at the Fifth
Solvay Conference held in Brussels in 1927, revived by David Bohm in
1952, and currently an active area of research by a small group of
physicists and philosophers. According to this theory, there are
particles with definite trajectories, that are guided by the quantum
wave function. For the history of the de Broglie theory, see the
introductory chapters of Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009. For any
overview of the de Broglie-Bohm theory and philosophical issues
associated with it see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-bohm/">Bohmian mechanics</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There have been other proposals for supplementing the quantum state
with additional structure; these have come to be called <em>modal
interpretations</em>; see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-modal/">modal interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>
 </p>

<h4>4.2.3 Dynamical Collapse Theories</h4>

<p>
As already mentioned, von Neumann and Dirac wrote as if the collapse
of the quantum state vector precipitated by an experimental
intervention on the system is a genuine physical change, distinct from
the usual unitary evolution. If collapse is to be taken as a genuine
physical process, then something more needs to be said about the
circumstances under which it occurs than merely that it happens when
an experiment is performed. This gives rise to a research programme of
formulating a precisely defined dynamics for the quantum state that
approximates the linear, unitary Schr&ouml;dinger evolution in
situations for which this is well-confirmed, and produces collapse to
an eigenstate of the outcome variable in typical experimental set-ups,
or, failing that, a close approximation to an eigenstate. The only
promising collapse theories are stochastic in nature; indeed, it can
be shown that a deterministic collapse theory would permit
superluminal signalling. (see the entry on 
 <a href="../qm-collapse/">collapse theories</a>
 for an overview).</p>

<p>
<em>Prima facie</em>, a dynamical collapse theory of this type can be
a quantum state monist theory, one on which, in Bell&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;the wave function is everything&rdquo;. In recent years, this
has been disputed; it has been argued that collapse theories require
&ldquo;primitive ontology&rdquo; in addition to the quantum state. See
Allori <em>et al.</em> 2008; also the entry on
 <a href="../qm-collapse/">collapse theories</a>,
 and references therein.</p>

<h4>4.2.4 Everettian, or &ldquo;many worlds&rdquo; theories</h4>

<p>
In his doctoral dissertation of 1957 (reprinted in Everett 2012), Hugh
Everett III proposed that quantum mechanics be taken as it is, without
a collapse postulate and without any &ldquo;hidden variables&rdquo;.
The resulting interpretation he called the <em>relative state</em>
interpretation.</p>

<p>
The basic idea is this. After an experiment, the quantum state of the
system plus apparatus is typically a superposition of terms
corresponding to distinct outcomes. As the apparatus interacts with
its environment, which may include observers, these systems become
entangled with the apparatus and quantum system, the net result of
which is a quantum state involving, for each of the possible
experimental outcomes, a term in which the apparatus reading
corresponds to that outcome, there are records of that outcome in the
environment, observers observe that outcome, <em>etc.</em>. Everett
proposed that each of these terms be taken to be equally real. From a
God&rsquo;s-eye-view, there is no unique experimental outcome, but one
can also focus on a particular determinate state of one subsystem,
say, the experimental apparatus, and attribute to the other systems
participating in the entangled state a <em>relative state</em>,
relative to that state of the apparatus. That is, relative to the
apparatus reading &lsquo;+&rsquo; is a state of the environment
recording that result and states of observers observing that result
(see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-everett/">Everett&rsquo;s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics</a>,
 for more detail on Everett&rsquo;s views). </p>

<p>
Everett&rsquo;s work has inspired a family of views that go by the
name of &ldquo;Many Worlds&rdquo; interpretations; the idea is that
each of the terms of the superposition corresponds to a coherent
world, and all of these worlds are equally real. As time goes on,
there is a proliferation of these worlds, as situations arise that
give rise to a further multiplicity of outcomes (see the entry
 <a href="../qm-manyworlds/">many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>,
 and Saunders 2007, for overviews of recent discussions; Wallace 2012
is an extended defense of an Everettian interpretation of quantum
mechanics).</p>

<p>
There is a family of distinct, but related views, that go by the name
of &ldquo;Relational Quantum Mechanics&rdquo;. These views agree with
Everett in attributing to a system definite values of dynamical
variables only relative to the states of other systems; they differ in
that, unlike Everett, they do not take the quantum state as their
basic ontology (see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-relational/">relational quantum mechanics</a>
 for more detail).</p>

<h3 id="RoleDeco">4.3 The role of decoherence</h3>

<p>
A quantum state that is a superposition of two distinct terms, such
as</p> 

\[
\ket{\psi}  = a \ket{\psi_{1}}  + b \ket{\psi_{2}} ,
\]

<p>
where \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) and \(\ket{\psi_{2}}\) are distinguishable
states, is not the same state as a mixture of \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) and
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\), which would be appropriate for a situation in
which the state prepared was either \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) or
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\), but we don&rsquo;t know which. The difference
between a coherent superposition of two terms and a mixture has
empirical consequences. To see this, consider the double-slit
experiment, in which a beam of particles (such as electrons, neutrons,
or photons) passes through two narrow slits and then impinges on a
screen, where the particles are detected. Take \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) to
be a state in which a particle passes through the top slit, and
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\), a state in which it passes through the bottom
slit. The fact that the state is a superposition of these two
alternatives is exhibited in interference fringes at the screen,
alternating bands of high and low rates of absorption.</p>

<p>
This is often expressed in terms of a difference between classical and
quantum probabilities. If the particles were classical particles, the
probability of detection at some point \(p\) of the screen would
simply be a weighted average of two conditional probabilities: the
probability of detection at \(p\), given that the particle passed
through the top slit, and the probability of detection at \(p\), given
that the particle passed through the bottom slit. The appearance of
interference is an index of nonclassicality.</p>

<p>
Suppose, now, that the electrons interact with something else (call it
the <em>environment</em>) on the way to the screen, that could serve
as a &ldquo;which-way&rdquo; detector; that is, the state of this
auxiliary system becomes entangled with the state of the electron in
such a way that its state is correlated with \(\ket{\psi_{1}}\) and
\(\ket{\psi_{2}}\). Then the state of the quantum system, \(s\), and
its environment, \(e\), is</p> 

\[
\ket{\psi} _{se} = a \ket{ \psi_{1}} _{s} \ket{ \phi_{1}} _{e} + b \ket{ \psi_{2}}_{s} \ket{ \phi_{2}} _{e}
\]

<p>
If the environment states \(\ket{\phi_{1}} _{e}\) are
\(\ket{\phi_{2}}_{e}\) are distinguishable states, then this
completely destroys the interference fringes: the particles interact
with the screen as if they determinately went through one slit or the
other, and the pattern that emerges is the result of overlaying the
two single-slit patterns. That is, we can treat the particles as if
they obeyed (approximately) definite trajectories, and apply
probabilities in a classical manner.</p>

<p>
Now, macroscopic objects are typically in interaction with a large and
complex environment&mdash;they are constantly being bombarded with air
molecules, photons, and the like. As a result, the reduced state of
such a system quickly becomes a mixture of quasi-classical states, a
phenomenon known as <em>decoherence</em>.</p>

<p>
A generalization of decoherence lies at the heart of an approach to
the interpretation of quantum mechanics that goes by the name of
<em>decoherent histories approach</em> (see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-consistent-histories/">the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics</a>
 for an overview).</p>

<p>
Decoherence plays important roles in the other approaches to quantum
mechanics, though the role it plays varies with approach; see the entry on
 <a href="../qm-decoherence/">the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics</a>
 for information on this.</p>

<h3 id="CompApprMeasProb">4.4 Comparison of approaches to the measurement problem</h3>

<p>
All of the above approaches take it that the goal is to provide an
account of events in the world that recovers, at least in some
approximation, something like our familiar world of ordinary objects
behaving classically. None of the mainstream approaches accord any
special <em>physical</em> role to conscious observers. There have,
however, been proposals in that direction (see the entry on
 <a href="../qt-consciousness/">quantum approaches to consciousness</a>
 for discussion).</p>

<p>
All of the above-mentioned approaches are consistent with observation.
Mere consistency, however, is not enough; the rules for connecting
quantum theory with experimental results typically involve nontrivial
(that is, not equal to zero or one) probabilities assigned to
experimental outcomes. These calculated probabilities are confronted
with empirical evidence in the form of statistical data from repeated
experiments. Extant hidden-variables theories reproduce the quantum
probabilities, and collapse theories have the intriguing feature of
reproducing very close approximations to quantum probabilities for all
experiments that have been performed so far but departing from the
quantum probabilities for other conceivable experiments. This permits,
in principle, an empirical discrimination between such theories and
no-collapse theories.</p>

<p>
A criticism that has been raised against Everettian theories is that
it is not clear whether they can even make sense of statistical
testing of this kind, as it does not, in any straightforward way, make
sense to talk of the probability of obtaining, say, a &lsquo;+&rdquo;
outcome of a given experiment when it is certain that all possible
outcomes will occur on some branch of the wavefunction. This has been
called the &ldquo;Everettian evidential problem&rdquo;. It has been
the subject of much recent work on Everettian theories; see Saunders
(2007) for an introduction and overview.</p>

<p>
If one accepts that Everettians have a solution to the evidential
problem, then, among the major lines of approach, none is favored in a
straightforward way by the empirical evidence. If one is to make a
decision as to which, if any, one should accept, it is to be made on
other grounds. There will not be space here to give an in-depth
overview of these ongoing discussions, but a few considerations can be
mentioned, to give the reader a flavor of the discussions; see entries
on particular approaches for more detail.</p>

<p>
Bohmians claim, in favor of the Bohmian approach, that a theory on
these lines provides the most straightforward picture of events;
ontological issues are less clear-cut when it comes to Everettian
theories or collapse theories.</p>

<p>
Another consideration is compatibility with relativistic causal
structure. The de Broglie-Bohm theory requires a distinguished
relation of distant simultaneity for its formulation, and, it can be
argued, this is an ineliminable feature of any hidden-variables theory
of this sort, that selects some observable to always have definite
values (see Berndl <em>et al.</em> 1996; Myrvold 2002). On the other
hand, there are collapse models that are fully relativistic. On such
models, collapses are localized events. Though probabilities of
collapses at spacelike separation from each other are not independent,
this probabilistic dependence does not require us to single one out as
earlier and the other later. Thus, such theories do not require a
distinguished relation of distant simultaneity. There remains,
however, some discussion of how to equip such theories with beables
(or &ldquo;elements of reality&rdquo;). See the entry on
 <a href="../qm-collapse/">collapse theories</a>
 and references therein; see also, for some recent contributions to the
discussion, Fleming 2016, Maudlin 2016, and Myrvold 2016.</p>

<p>
In the case of Everettian theories, one must first think about how to
formulate the question of relativistic locality. Several authors have
approached this issue in somewhat different ways, with a common
conclusion that Everettian quantum mechanics is, indeed, local. (See
Vaidman 1994; Baccialuppi 2002; Chapter 8 of Wallace 2012; Tipler
2014; Vaidman 2016; and Brown and Timpson 2016.)</p>

<h2 id="OntoIssu">5. Ontological Issues</h2>

<p>
As mentioned, a central question of interpretation of quantum
mechanics concerns whether quantum states should be regarded as
representing anything in physical reality. If this is answered in the
affirmative, this gives rise to new questions, namely, what sort of
physical reality is represented by the quantum state, and whether a
quantum state could in principle give an exhaustive account of
physical reality.</p>

<h3 id="QuesQuanStatReal">5.1 The question of quantum state realism.</h3>

<p>
Harrigan and Spekkens (2010) have introduced a framework for
discussing these issues. In their terminology, a complete
specification of the physical properties is given by the <em>ontic
state</em> of a system. An ontological model posits a space of ontic
states and associates, with any preparation procedure, a probability
distribution over ontic states. A model is said to be
\(\psi\)-<em>ontic</em> if the ontic state uniquely determines the
quantum state; that is, if there is a function from ontic states to
quantum states (this includes both cases in which the quantum state
also completely determines the physical state, and cases, such as
hidden-variables theories, in which the quantum state does not
completely determine the physical state). In their terminology, models
that are not \(\psi\)-ontic are called \(\psi\)<em>-epistemic</em>. If
a model is not \(\psi\)-ontic, this means that it is possible for some
ontic states to be the result of two or more preparations that lead to
different assignments of pure quantum states; that is, the same ontic
state may be compatible with distinct quantum states.</p>

<p>
This gives a nice way of posing the question of quantum state realism:
are there preparations corresponding to distinct pure quantum states
that can give rise to the same ontic state, or, conversely, are there
ontic states compatible with distinct quantum states? Pusey, Barrett,
and Rudolph (2012) showed that, if one adopts a natural independence
assumption about state preparations&mdash;namely, the assumption that
it is possible to prepare a pair of systems in such a way that the
probabilities for ontic states of the two systems are effectively
independent&mdash;then the answer is negative; any ontological model
that reproduces quantum predictions and satisfies this Preparation
Independence assumption must be a \(\psi\)-ontic model.</p>

<p>
The Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) theorem does not close off all
options for anti-realism about quantum states; an anti-realist about
quantum states could reject the Preparation Independence assumption,
or reject the framework within which the theorem is set; see
discussion in Spekkens 2015: 92&ndash;93. See also Leifer (2014) for a
careful and thorough overview of theorems relevant to quantum state
realism.</p>

<h3 id="OntoCateQuanStat">5.2 Ontological category of quantum states</h3>

<p>
The major realist approaches to the measurement problem are all, in
some sense, realist about quantum states. Merely saying this is
insufficient to give an account of the ontology of a given
interpretation. Among the questions to be addressed are: if quantum
states represent something physically real, what sort of thing is it?
This is the question of the ontological construal of quantum states.
Another question is the EPR question, whether a description in terms
of quantum states can be taken as, in principle, complete, or whether
it must be supplemented by different ontology.</p>

<p>
De Broglie&rsquo;s original conception of the &ldquo;pilot wave&rdquo;
was that it would be a field, analogous to an electromagnetic field.
The original conception was that each particle would have its own
guiding wave. However, in quantum mechanics as it was developed at the
hands of Schr&ouml;dinger, for a system of two or more particles we
don&rsquo;t have individual wave functions for each particle, but,
rather, a single wave function that is defined on \(n\)-tuples of
points in space, where \(n\) is the number of particles. This was
taken, by de Broglie, Schr&ouml;dinger and others, to militate against
the conception of quantum wave functions as fields. If quantum states
represent something in physical reality, they are unlike anything
familiar in classical physics.</p>

<p>
One response that has been taken is to insist that quantum wave
functions are fields nonetheless, albeit fields on a space of
enormously high dimension, namely, \(3n\), where \(n\) is the number
of elementary particles in the universe. On this view, this
high-dimensional space is thought of as more fundamental than the
familiar three-dimensional space (or four-dimensional spacetime) that
is usually taken to be the arena of physical events. See Albert (1996,
2013), for the classic statement of the view; other proponents include
Loewer (1996), Lewis (2004), Ney (2012, 2013a,b, 2015), and North
(2013). Most of the discussion of this proposal has taken place within
the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is not a
fundamental theory. It has been argued that considerations of how the
wave functions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics arise from a
quantum field theory undermines the idea that wave functions are
relevantly like fields on configuration space, and also the idea that
configuration spaces can be thought of as more fundamental than
ordinary spacetime (Myrvold 2015).</p>

<p>
A view that takes a wave function as a field on a high-dimensional
space must be distinguished from a view that takes it to be what Belot
(2012) has called a <em>multi-field</em>, which assigns properties to
\(n\)-tuples of points of ordinary three-dimensional space. These are
distinct views; proponents of the \(3n\)-dimensional conception make
much of the fact that it restores Separability: on this view, a
complete specification of the way the world is, at some time, is given
by specification of local states of affairs at each address in the
fundamental (\(3n\)-dimensional) space. Taking a wave function to be a
multi-field, on the other hand, involves accepting nonseparability.
Another difference between taking wave-functions as multi-fields on
ordinary space and taking them to be fields on a high-dimensional
space is that, on the multi-field view, there is no question about the
relation of ordinary three-dimensional space to some more fundamental
space.&shy;</p>

<p>
It has been argued that, on the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory and
related pilot wave theories, the quantum state plays a role more
similar to that of a law in classical mechanics; its role is to
provide dynamics for the Bohmian corpuscles, which, according to the
theory, compose ordinary objects. See D&uuml;rr, Goldstein, and
Zangh&igrave; 1997 and Allori <em>et al.</em> 2008.</p>

<p>
D&uuml;rr, Goldstein, and Zangh&igrave; (1992) introduced the term
&ldquo;primitive ontology&rdquo; for what, according to a physical
theory, makes up ordinary physical objects; on the de Broglie-Bohm
theory, this is the Bohmian corpuscles. The conception is extended to
interpretations of collapse theories by Allori <em>et al.</em> (2008).
Primitive ontology is to be distinguished from other ontology, such as
the quantum state, that is introduced into the theory to account for
the behavior of the primitive ontology. The distinction is meant to be
a guide as to how to conceive of the nonprimitive ontology of the
theory.</p>

<h2 id="QuanCompQuanInfoTheo">6. Quantum computing and quantum information theory</h2>

<p>
Quantum mechanics has not only given rise to interpretational
conundrums; it has given rise to new concepts in computing and in
information theory. <em>Quantum information theory</em> is the study
of the possibilities for information processing and transmission
opened up by quantum theory. This has given rise to a different
perspective on quantum theory, one on which, as Bub (2000, 597) put
it, &ldquo;the puzzling features of quantum mechanics are seen as a
resource to be developed rather than a problem to be solved&rdquo;
(see the entries on
 <a href="../qt-quantcomp/">quantum computing</a>
 and
 <a href="../qt-entangle/">quantum entanglement and information</a>).
 </p>

<h2 id="RecoQuanMechBeyo">7. Reconstructions of quantum mechanics and beyond</h2>

<p>
Another area of active research in the foundations of quantum
mechanics is the attempt to gain deeper insight into the structure of
the theory, and the ways in which it differs from both classical
physics and other theories that one might construct, by characterizing
the structure of the theory in terms of very general principles, often
with an information-theoretic flavour.</p>

<p>
This project has its roots in early work of Mackey (1957, 1963),
Ludwig (1964), and Piron (1964) aiming to characterize quantum
mechanics in operational terms. This has led to the development of a
framework of generalized probabilistic model. It also has connections
with the investigations into quantum logic initiated by Birkhoff and
von Neumann (1936) (see the entry
 <a href="../qt-quantlog/">quantum logic and probability theory</a>
 for an overview).</p>

<p>
Interest in the project of deriving quantum theory from axioms with
clear operational content was revived by the work of Hardy (2001
[2008], Other Internet Resources).  Significant results along these
lines include the axiomatizations of Masanes and M&uuml;ller (2011)
and Chiribella, D&rsquo;Ariano, and Perinotti (2011). See Chiribella  and Spekkens 
2015 for a snapshot of the state of the art of this
endeavour.</p>
