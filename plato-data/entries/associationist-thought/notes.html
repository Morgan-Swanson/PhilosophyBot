<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Associationist Theories of Thought</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a> Empiricists who have
wanted more than one type of learning mechanism have tended to be
constructivists. The basic constructivist position is to posit a
single mental process, the ability to associate ideas, and to
construct new processes out of the single innate process (see, Fodor
1983 for discussion).
</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> Though many later
associationists, such as Pavlov and the behaviorists, had only one
mental process, Hume in fact also had the imagination. For discussion
on how the imagination meshes with Hume&rsquo;s empiricism and
associationism see Fodor (2003).</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> That said, one can detect
aspects of associationism in earlier writers, such as Descartes when
discussing memory and Spinoza when discussing the emotions (see the
entry on <a href="../descartes/">Descartes</a> and
on <a href="">17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions</a>.</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> Although Hume is generally
acknowledged as laying the theoretical foundation of associationism,
there is some evidence that Francis Hutcheson&rsquo;s use of
associations greatly influenced him. See the entry
on <a href="../scottish-18th/">Scottish Philosophy in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century</a>.</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> &ldquo;All our simple
ideas in their first appearance are deriv&rsquo;d from simple
impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly
represent&rdquo; (T 1.1.1.7/4).</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> This is a bit of a loose
formulation. Strictly speaking, impressions themselves don&rsquo;t
instantiate any associative relation, rather the contents of the
Impressions do. For example, it isn&rsquo;t that one&rsquo;s
Impression (understood as a vehicle of thought) of chickens resembles
roosters; rather it&rsquo;s the content of one&rsquo;s impressions
resemble one another. Presumably, all Impressions qua vehicles of
thought resemble one another merely by being Impressions. What differs
between Impressions is, e.g., whether the content they represent
resembles other represented content. This distinction between vehicle
and content is important for Hume&rsquo;s overall architecture:
it&rsquo;s not the vehicle of the Impression that gets copied into an
Idea, but rather the content of that vehicle. That said, to ease
exposition the distinction between vehicles and contents is elided in
the main text except where it is important to distinguish.</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> Although some contemporary
associationist views still retain all three original Humean
associative relations, the resemblance relation has come under the
most scrutiny and is the least popular of the three. For discussions
of the problem of the resemblance criterion see Field and Davey
(1999), and De Houwer (2009). In the canonical Rescorla Wagner model
(Rescorla and Wagner 1972), both contiguity and resemblance are
superseded by the contingency requirement.</p>

<p>
<a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> A variation on classical
conditioning is evaluative conditioning, where one tries to transfer
the valence of the US onto the CS (see, e.g., De Houwer et al. 2001
for an overview). For instance, one might pair a favorable flavor
(e.g., sugar) with a novel neutral face stimulus, in order to transfer
the positive valence to the previously neutral face.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> There are many
different ways of construing the details of Pavlovian
conditioning. For example, some would restrict the usage further by
arguing that the US must be biologically significant, or widen the
usage, as Rescorla does
(see <a href="index.html#RelBetVarAssRelPos">section 7</a>). Some
anti-associationists even believe that Pavlovian conditioning is real,
but not predicated on associations (Mitchell et al. 2009).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> Classical
conditioning also had some consequences that were a bit unpalatable
for empiricists: if all learning was to be given as forming
associative bonds between USs, CSs, and responses, then all of our
learning had to bottom out in some behaviors that were preprogrammed
to correspond to certain stimuli: in other words, certain instinctual
patterns of behavior were innately set to be elicited by certain
stimuli. Even more problematically, such instinctual patterns were apt
to be species specific, so not generalizable to humans.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> Note how Thorndike
does not hesitate to speak of mental states like satisfaction and
dissatisfaction, as opposed to the most famous practitioner of operant
conditioning, the radical behaviorist B.F. Skinner (see
the <a href="../behaviorism/">behaviorism entry</a>).</p>

<div>
<p> <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> From this level of
abstraction, Pavlov and Skinner were united. Here&rsquo;s
Garcia&rsquo;s on Skinnerian learning:
</p><blockquote><p> Any stimulus applied immediately after the
response which, by empirical test, would increase response production
was deemed a reinforcer&hellip;The general procedures were said to be
applicable to any and all reflexes, in any and all organisms. There
was no need to concern ourselves with species differences, with brain
differences, or with reinforcer differences.  The payoff
schedule&rsquo;s the thing wherein we&rsquo;d capture control of the
organism. (Garcia 1981: 155)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> Radical
behaviorists such as Skinner (e.g., 1953) would deny this claim, but
only because of their ontological objections to reifying mental
states. But Eliminativism of the mental is a different thesis than
associationism, although both fit together well
(see <a href="index.html#AssIns">section 6</a>).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> Hereafter I will
use the forward slash to denote an associative bond between the
entities on either side of the slash. Additionally, expressions
written in small caps will be used to denote concepts, and I will
assume that the concepts&rsquo; structural descriptions are given by
the expressions.  Thus <span class="sc">red bird</span> is taken to be a complex concept
consisting of two meaningful parts, the concept 
<span class="sc">red</span> and the concept
<span class="sc">bird</span>. However, <span class="sc">bird</span>
will be assumed to be a simple concept with no
semantically decomposable parts. The structural descriptions are
stipulated for exegetical reasons and without commitment to the actual
structure of the corresponding concepts.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> The mediation
parenthetical can get a bit complicated to state, for one might want
to claim that, e.g., <span class="sc">wrench</span>
and <span class="sc">hammer</span> are associated, even if the
association is mediated through a link between <span class="sc">screwdriver</span>. 
In which case, it&rsquo;s best to say that two concepts form a basic
associative structure if the activation of one concept brings on the
activation of another without there being any other mediating
psychological variable.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> This claim should
be qualified in a few ways. First, the mapping might not be a full
mapping of a single thinker as opposed to a subsystem of a single
thinker (such as their intramodular representation of their lexicon,
see Fodor 1983).  Secondly, the mapping needn&rsquo;t be between
concepts per se, and can instead be between mental representations
that for some reason or another one needn&rsquo;t bestow the honorific
of &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; to (because, for example, the mental
representations are intramodular and thus not properly
&ldquo;general&rdquo;, see Evans 1982).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
&ldquo;Experiencing <em>X</em>s and <em>Y</em>s&rdquo; generally means
something such as &ldquo;having formed representations of <em>X</em>s
and <em>Y</em>s based on their appearance in the ambient
environment,&rdquo; but needn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that. If one
just happened to keep thinking <em>x</em> followed by <em>y</em> for
any reason, even though <em>X</em>s and <em>Y</em>s weren&rsquo;t
given in experience that too could change the associative strength of
the <em>x</em>/<em>y</em> bond. Additionally, some theories allow
&ldquo;piggybacking&rdquo; associations&mdash;associations formed from
activated propositional structures. For example, constantly having the
propositional thought <span class="sc">molly owns a dog</span> could affect the associative
bond between <span class="sc">molly</span> and <span class="sc">dog</span> 
(see Mandelbaum forthcoming for discussion).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> Although bare-boned
associationism provides a good approximation of Hume and Pavlov, it
doesn&rsquo;t quite capture the full theory of those working in
operant conditioning paradigms for it doesn&rsquo;t involve any notion
of reinforcement, or updating one&rsquo;s associative structure based
on consequences. This isn&rsquo;t accidental: how to square cognitive
updating (i.e., association-based or belief-based updating) based on
consequences with the Spartan tenets of associationism has often been
a point of difficulty (see, e.g., Festinger and Carlsmith 1959). </p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> Curiously, it
appears that extinction isn&rsquo;t very effective in evaluative
conditioning paradigms, though counterconditioning is (see De Houwer
2011 for many citations, such as Diaz et al. 2005 and Vansteenwegen et
al. 2006).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> Technically,
reinstatement is the reappearance of the CR upon reexposure to the US
after successful extinction, whereas spontaneous recovery is the name
for the return of the associative pairing just due to the passage of
time. Both reinstatement and spontaneous recovery are related, and
both provide difficulties for the traditional view of extinction.</p>

<div>
<p> <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a> Interestingly,
Locke also seemed to understand the nature of taste aversions
(see <a href="index.html#AgaConAnaAss">section 9.4</a>):
</p><blockquote><p> A grown person surfeiting with honey no sooner
hears the name of it, but his fancy immediately carries sickness and
qualms to his stomach, and he cannot bear the very idea of it; other
ideas of dislike, and sickness, and vomiting, presently accompany it,
and he is disturbed; but he knows from whence to date this weakness,
and can tell how he got this indisposition. Had this happened to him
by an over-dose of honey when a child, all the same effects would have
followed; but the cause would have been mistaken, and the antipathy
counted natural. (Locke 1690: 2.23.7).</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a> In the example of
associative transitions offered above, we used associations between
propositions. But of course a pure associationist view would not allow
propositional structures. It is thus a bit more difficult for a pure
associationist to distinguish associative transitions from associative
structures. For the pure associationist, all transitions are
associative transitions among associative structures, for association
is the only available mental process and associative structures the
only available mental structure. Thus, for the pure associationist,
the only possible difference between an associative structure and an
associative transition is a contingent temporal one (where an
associative structure is ideally contemporaneous whereas an
associative transition unfolds over time).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> The question of how
many levels of explanation one allows in their cognitive architecture
is a wholly separate question of whether any of those architectures
are associationistic. Generalizations here vary wildly from theorist
to theorist. For example, many theorists, roughly following Marr
(1982), assume there is just one algorithmic
(psychological/representational) level which is then instantiated in a
physical (neurological) level (see, e.g., Mitchell et
al. 2009). Others generally assume that there are multiple
psychological levels. For instance, Fodor writes, &ldquo;psychological
faculties at the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> level are typically
implemented by psychological faculties at
the <em>n</em>&minus;1<sup>th</sup> level&rdquo; (2003: 132).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a> In this context,
&ldquo;sub-symbolic&rdquo; just means that the node on its own has no
semantic value. In other words, a single node wouldn&rsquo;t represent
any content.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> There are no
domain-specific associationists because associative learning is
incompatible with domain specificity. Domain specificity assumes
different mental processes for different domains, and associative
learning presupposes the same learning mechanism regardless of
domain.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a> For example, in a
&ldquo;default-interventionist&rdquo; model System 2 processes are not
always engaged though they are in &ldquo;parallel competitive&rdquo;
models (both models include the constant automatic engagement of
System 1). See Evans and Stanovich 2013 for discussion.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a> Gallistel and King
(2009: 239) argue that there is no such window. Instead they argue
that what matters for learning in place of contiguity is a ratio of
the time between the presentation of the CS and the appearance of the
US as compared to the time between different US presentations (in a
given context). For example, speeding up the CS/US connection by a
factor of two reduces the amount of US presentations one needs by
half.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a> It appears that
content specificity of associations needn&rsquo;t just be based on
innate dispositions. For example, in an evaluative conditioning
paradigm using odors as USs and faces as CSs, the evaluative
conditioning only commenced when the odors were interpreted as
plausibly human (Todrank et al. 1995). But &ldquo;plausibly
human&rdquo; included learned information (such as the odors
associated with soap). When the odors were typically associated with
objects and not humans, no learning transpired. Additionally, there
appears to be content-specific differences in associative learning at
a greater level of abstraction: there is evidence that negative US/CS
pairings are learned more quickly, and form stronger bonds than
positive US/CS pairings (Rozin 1986, Baeyens et al. 1990.)</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a> Blocking has been
observed in humans (see Dickinson et al. 1984) but one needn&rsquo;t
delve into the empirical literature to feel the pull of the
phenomenon.  Imagine you&rsquo;ve eaten an orange and immediately have
an allergic reaction. If in your next meal you eat an orange and an
apple and have the allergic reaction, you will be less likely to think
the apple caused the reaction than you would were you to have never
experienced the allergic reaction after eating the orange.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a> More
problematically for associationists, blocking doesn&rsquo;t always
work, but when it doesn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t predictable by associative
theory. For example, if a weak odor is paired with a strong taste and
the pairing is followed by gastrointestinal distress, the taste
magnifies the sensitivity of the odor as a signal (Rusiniak et al.
1979). Relatedly, if a hawk eats a black mouse and gets sick,
the hawk won&rsquo;t just avoid black mice but will avoid all
mice. However, if the black mouse tastes different than a white mouse,
then the hawk will continue to eat white mice even after black mice
make it sick (Brett et al. 1976).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a> Oddly enough,
evaluative conditioning does not seem as sensitive to base rates or as
susceptible to &ldquo;occasion setting&rdquo; as classical
conditioning is. See De Houwer et al. 2001).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a> The more one looks
into how locational properties become associated, the more problems
seem to mount. For example, if a rat has a strong preference for a
particular drink but gets shocked while ingesting that drink, the rat
will not change its preference of the flavor. Instead, the rat will
just learn to avoid the drink when it encounters it in the
experimental location.  But when the rat is given a chance to ingest
the drink anywhere else (e.g., back in its home cage) it will still
continue to ingest the drink. Furthermore, in the case where the rat
gets shocked while drinking the highly desirable flavor in the Skinner
box on trial <em>N</em>, the rat will increase how much of the drink
it will intake on trial <em>N</em>+1.  This is a reasonable strategy:
assuming that one knows they are going to get shocked, they might as
well intake as much as possible while getting shocked. For more on
these points, see Garcia (et al.  1970). </p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a> In other versions
of the problem it is understood as the problem the organism faces in
trying to figure out which of its behaviors produced the environmental
change that interests the organism. It also appears in problems in
Artificial Intelligence (see Minksy 1963).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a> For a pure
associationist, one would phrase this as the organism learning to
associate the lack of CS with the US. How the pure associationist
analyzes the absence of a CS while using only associative structures
can also be a difficult issue.</p>
