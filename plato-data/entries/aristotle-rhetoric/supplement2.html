<h2>The <em>topoi</em> of the Rhetoric</h2>

<p>

Interpreters are faced with the problem that the use of the word 
&lsquo;<em>topos</em>&rsquo; in Aristotle's <em>Rhetoric</em> is much
more heterogeneous than in the <em>Topics</em>. Beside <em>topoi</em>
which do perfectly comply with the description given in the 
<em>Topics</em>, there is an important group of <em>topoi</em> in the
<em>Rhetoric</em> that contain instructions for arguments not of a 
certain form, but with a certain predicate (for example, that 
something is good, or honorable, or just, or contributes to 
happiness, etc.). While those material <em>topoi</em> are still used 
to build arguments, there are also uses of 
&lsquo;<em>topos</em>&rsquo; in the context of the non-argumentative 
means of persuasion. </p>

<p>

In I.2, 1358a2&ndash;35 Aristotle distinguishes between 
general/common <em>topoi</em> on the one hand and specific 
<em>topoi</em> on the other hand. In chapter I.2 he explains the 
sense of &lsquo;specific&rsquo; by pointing out that some things are 
specific to physics, others to ethics, etc. But from chapter I.3 on, 
he makes us think that &lsquo;specific&rsquo; refers to the different
species of rhetoric, so that some <em>topoi</em> are specific to 
deliberative, other to epideictic, and still others to juridical 
speech. While he is inclined to call the general or common 
<em>topoi</em> simply &lsquo;<em>topoi</em>&rsquo;, he uses several 
names for the specific <em>topoi</em> (<em>idiai protaseis</em>, 
<em>eid&ecirc;</em>, <em>idioi topoi</em>). Roughly, it is clear that
the specific <em>topoi</em> can be found in the first and the common 
<em>topoi</em> in the second book of the <em>Rhetoric</em>. Most 
interpreters assumed that all common <em>topoi</em> are listed in 
chapters II.23&ndash;24 (real enthymemes in II.23, fallacious 
enthymemes in II.24), but failed to notice that more common 
<em>topoi</em> can be found in II.19. Further, it may be tempting to 
call, as some do, the specific <em>topoi</em> &lsquo;material&rsquo; 
and the common <em>topoi</em> &lsquo;formal&rsquo;; but in so doing, 
interpreters often neglected that some of the common <em>topoi</em> 
in chapters II.23&ndash;24 are not all based on those formal 
categories on which the <em>topoi</em> of the <em>Topics</em> rely. 
Most of them are &lsquo;common&rsquo; only in the sense that they are
not specific to one single species of speech. Some of them only offer
strategic advice, for example, to turn what has been said against 
oneself upon the one who said it. For this reason, it is completely 
misleading to say that the functions of specific and common 
<em>topoi</em> are complementary, insofar as the common 
<em>topoi</em> allegedly offer the logical form to a content that has
been provided by the specific ones.</p>

<h3>The specific <em>topoi</em> of the Rhetoric</h3>

<p>

Since Aristotle sometimes calls the specific <em>topoi</em> 
&lsquo;<em>protaseis</em>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<em>protasis</em>&rsquo;
is at the same time the Greek word for &lsquo;premise&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;statement, sentence&rsquo;, his treatment of specific 
<em>topoi</em> gave rise to serious confusions. Several authors 
subscribed to the view of Friedrich Solmsen that there are two types 
of enthymemes, insofar as some are taken from <em>topoi</em> and some
are built from premises, not from <em>topoi</em>. According to this 
view, the specific <em>topoi</em> given in the first book of the 
<em>Rhetoric</em> are the premises of the latter type of enthymemes, 
and the enthymemes of the former type are taken only from common 
<em>topoi</em>. From this point of view, only common <em>topoi</em> 
would be <em>topoi</em> in the proper sense, while specific 
<em>topoi</em> would be, strictly speaking, nothing else but 
premises. Accordingly, one would expect to find sentences of the form
&ldquo;All <em>F</em> are just/noble/good&rdquo; in the first book of
the <em>Rhetoric</em>; with such sentences one could construe 
syllogisms like &ldquo;All <em>F</em> are just/noble/good&mdash;This 
particular <em>x</em> is <em>F</em>&mdash;This particular <em>x</em> 
is just/noble/good.&rdquo; But what we actually find in the first 
book hardly fits Solmsen's model. In some sense we find more than the
required premises, insofar as Aristotle gives us not only isolated 
sentences, but also certain sentences together with a reason or a 
justification. Further Solmsen can hardly make sense of the fact that
Aristotle calls these alleged premises &lsquo;<em>topoi</em>&rsquo;. 
And above all, chapters I.6&ndash;7 of the <em>Rhetoric</em> offer 
<em>topoi</em> which can also be found in the third book of 
<em>Topics</em>; in the <em>Topics</em> they are clearly called 
&lsquo;<em>topoi</em>&rsquo;, so that there is no reason to assume 
that they are premises rather than <em>topoi</em>. </p>

<p>

The general idea by which the specific <em>topoi</em> can be 
characterized is rather this: Every specific <em>topos</em> gives us 
a general (but not formal) description of things that are supposed to
be good, noble, just, etc. It also gives us a reason enabling us to 
argue that the things described are good, noble, just, etc. 
Typically, this reason refers the given description back to a 
generally held definition of what is good, noble, just, etc., which 
is provided at the outset the several chapters. In some cases the 
reason is directly, in some cases indirectly linked with the initial 
definition. Example: The specific <em>topos</em> is: &ldquo;What is 
pleasant is good, since it is desirable.&rdquo; The phrase 
&ldquo;what is pleasant&rdquo; provides the general description, the 
phrase &ldquo;since it is desirable&rdquo; provides the reason. Now, 
at the beginning of the chapter the good has been defined as 
&ldquo;what is desirable&rdquo;. Another specific <em>topos</em> is 
&ldquo;honor is good, since it is pleasant&rdquo;; here the reason in
question applies the previous <em>topos</em> that what is pleasant is
good, so that the current <em>topos</em> is indirectly linked with 
the initial definition of what is good. The general description 
included in those <em>topoi</em> enables us to identify cases that 
the orator can present as good, noble, just, etc., the added reason 
shows us how to argue for the goodness, etc. of the selected things. 
Thus, the specific <em>topoi</em> provide not only premises but 
complete argumentative patterns.</p>

<h3>Several types of rhetorical topoi</h3>

<p>

The several topoi that can be found under the headings 
&lsquo;specific&rsquo; and &lsquo;common&rsquo; do not at all make up
two homogeneous classes. Some of them have only a vague affinity with
the standard form of <em>topoi</em> that prevails in the book 
<em>Topics</em>. Some so-called <em>topoi</em> of the 
<em>Rhetoric</em> belong neither to the specific nor to the common 
class, but are just instructions or patterns that are somehow useful 
in public speech. At least the following groups must be 
distinguished: </p>

 <a name="common">Typical</a>
 examples of group (i) can be found in chapters I.5&ndash;6 (first 
half), 9 and others. Starting from a definition of happiness, good, 
honorable and just, etc., these <em>topoi</em> instruct arguments to 
the effect that items of a certain type are part of happiness, are 
good, honorable, just, etc. The groups (ii) und (iii) have been 
inserted to indicate that the so-called specific <em>topoi</em> 
include various kinds of instructions: while the <em>topoi</em> of 
the first group offer determinate premises from which one can deduce 
that items of a certain type are good, just, etc., the <em>topoi</em>
of groups (ii) to (iii) help to construe diverse premises for items 
of several kinds. The <em>topoi</em> of group (iv) tell the orator 
what to say if one is using non-technical (i.e., artless) means of 
persuasion such as contracts, laws, witnesses, etc. Just like the 
<em>topoi</em> of group (x), which offers the orators formulas for 
slandering, the underlying concept of <em>topos</em> in this group is
essentially the same as in the pre-Aristotelian usage. The items 
mentioned in group (v), by which the orator should be enabled to 
arouse certain emotions in different contexts, are also called 
&lsquo;<em>topoi</em>&rsquo;, though they do not contribute to 
argumentation in the strictest sense. The formal character the 
<em>topoi</em> of group (vi) is quite similiar to that of the 
<em>topoi</em> of the <em>Topics</em>. The <em>topoi</em> of groups 
(vii) to (ix) are common insofar as they are not connected with a 
certain species of rhetoric. But while the <em>topoi</em> of group 
(vii) are roughly of the same type as the <em>topoi</em> of the 
<em>Topics</em>, other so-called &lsquo;common&rsquo; <em>topoi</em> 
are exclusively suited for rhetorical purposes; the <em>topoi</em> of
group (ix) only offer strategic advice.</p>
