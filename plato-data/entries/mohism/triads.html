<h2>Significance and Chronology of the Triads</h2>

<p>

Scholars have proposed various theories to explain the significance of
the three identically titled essays for each core Mohist doctrine. The
most important of these are the &ldquo;three factions&rdquo; theory,
A. C. Graham's modified version of the three factions theory, and the
&ldquo;successive revision&rdquo; theory. </p>

<p>

First proposed by the late Qing dynasty scholar Yu Yue (1821-1907),
the three factions theory holds that the three series of essays
&mdash; the &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; essays from each triad &mdash; represent the views
of three sects into which, according to a passage in Book 50 of
the <em>Hanfeizi</em> (ca. 233 BCE), the Mohists split after Mo Di's
death. Graham's theory also ascribes the essays to three different
factions, but he adjusts the arrangement of the texts, contending that
six of one faction's ten essays are missing and that three of the
shortest texts are digests or fragments inserted to replace lost
essays (Graham, 1985). He sees the three factions as having
distinctive doctrinal tendencies, which he characterizes as
&ldquo;Purist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Compromising,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Reactionary,&rdquo; respectively (1989, p. 51). The successive
revision theory holds that the essays in each triad represent three
sequential revisions of Mohist doctrines, the &ldquo;upper&rdquo;
being earliest, followed by the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; and then the
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; (Brooks 1996a-b-c; Fraser forthcoming [a],
forthcoming [b]).</p>

<p>

As Durrant (1977) and Graham (1985) have convincingly shown,
linguistic criteria can be used to divide the twenty-three extant
triad essays into three distinct groups. If the simple three factions
theory were correct, we would expect this linguistic classification to
yield three series of ten essays (allowing, of course, for the seven
essays now lost), and, ideally, to coincide with the division of the
essays into &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; series. In fact, however, the linguistic
classification leaves us with too many essays in one group and too few
in another for there to have been three linguistically distinct sets
of ten at the time the <em>Mozi</em> was compiled. For example, in at
least four triads, both the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and
&ldquo;middle&rdquo; essays fall into the first linguistic group, the
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; essay falls into the second, and the third is
empty. The simple three factions theory cannot explain these facts and
so must be rejected. The ten triads do not represent three series of
ten doctrines as propounded by three different Mohist factions.</p>

<p>

Graham's theory is in effect an attempt to salvage the three factions
theory in the face of this linguistic data. He suggests that the
&ldquo;extra&rdquo; essays in the first group &mdash; books 14, 17,
and 20 &mdash; are digests or fragments that replace
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; series essays already lost when the <em>Mozi</em>
was compiled. Because these replacements were shorter than the other
essays, they were placed first in their respective triads, thus
pushing the original &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and &ldquo;middle&rdquo;
series texts out of place and disrupting the original neat arrangement
of these series. This theory would explain why the second
linguistically defined group contains both three &ldquo;middle&rdquo;
essays and five &ldquo;lower&rdquo; essays (because the arrangement of
the original &ldquo;middle&rdquo; series has been disturbed), and why
the third group comprises only four essays (because the other six are
lost).</p>

<p>

However, the initial plausibility of Graham's theory fades under
scrutiny, largely because his key premise &mdash; that books 14, 17, and 20
are fragments or digests &mdash; is unsupported. Book 14 is not a digest of
the theme of its triad, since it is thematically distinct from the
other two texts: Its basic good is <em>zhi</em> (order), not
<em>li</em> (benefit) (Fraser forthcoming [a]). Parallels between
books 17, 26, and 28 are not grounds for thinking that 17 is a
fragment of 26, as Graham contends, because similar parallels can be
found between 18, 19, and 28 (Maeder 1992; Fraser 1997). Book 20 is
unlikely to be a digest, since it is actually <em>longer</em> than the
other extant text in its triad. Unfortunately, without this key
premise, Graham's theory amounts to little more than speculation and
circular reasoning. Though the linguistic evidence indicates that, as
far as we know, the core essays never formed three linguistically
distinct sets of ten, Graham assumes that they originally must
have. He then rearranges the triads and posits the existence of
unattested missing texts until he produces a scheme that conforms to
this assumption. In fact, however, the only reason to suppose there
were originally three complete, linguistically distinct series of
essays is the <em>Hanfeizi</em> comment about the Mohists splitting
into three factions. But no evidence &mdash; in the
<em>Hanfeizi</em> or elsewhere &mdash; actually connects these three
factions to the triads, and other evidence from the <em>Zhuangzi</em>
and <em>Lushi Chunqiu</em> suggests that there may in fact have been
six or more groups of Mohists, not three. Thus Graham's theory must be
rejected along with the original three factions theory.</p>

<p>

The successive revision theory proposes that we think of the three
linguistically identified groups of essays primarily not as the
canonical texts of three different Mohist factions, but as demarcating
three broad chronological strata (Brooks, 1996c). If we then apply
formal criteria to subdivide the first group into two further strata,
1a and 1b, we obtain the four-layer stratification shown in the table
below (for simplicity, we will consider only four strata, though in
fact each can be subdivided further; see Brooks, 1996c). The first two
columns of the table indicate the proposed strata and the linguistic
group associated with each. The next ten columns represent the ten
triads. The numbers in the body of the table represent books 8-37 of
the <em>Mozi</em>, which constitute the triads. The small letters
<em>u</em>, <em>m</em>, and <em>l</em> &nbsp; each book number
indicate the &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; books in each triad. Parentheses indicate the
seven books missing from the received text of the
<em>Mozi</em>.</p>

<p>

Once the first linguistic group is subdivided as shown, it turns out
that the stratification based on the three linguistic groups is
consistent with the labeling of the essays as &ldquo;upper,&rdquo;
&ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo; within each triad. That
is, within each triad, the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; essay falls into a
stratum that predates the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; essay, which in turn
predates the &ldquo;lower.&rdquo; (The one exception &mdash; the
placement of Book 37 in the second group and 36 in the third, as
indicated by asterisks in the table &mdash; appears to be due to
textual dislocation in these books.) Thus the successive revision
theory explains the significance of the upper-middle-lower
classification in a way consistent with the linguistic classification,
but without assuming that the traditional arrangement of the texts is
faulty and without positing unknown missing texts, as Graham's theory
does.</p>

<p>

In itself, this correspondence between the upper-middle-lower
classification and the proposed chronological stratification provides
only <em>prima facie</em> support for the successive revision theory.
The fit between the two could be a coincidence. But this theory also
seems to provide the best explanation of numerous formal and thematic
features of the essays (Brooks 1996a-b-c; Fraser forthcoming [a], [b];
Watanabe 1973, proposes a related view). For instance, as we move
from the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; to the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; essays within each triad, we find that the texts
become longer and give more complete arguments, including extensive
answers to objections. They begin to give historical examples and cite
ancient texts to support their contentions. Issues are discussed in
greater detail and with greater rhetorical and theoretical
sophistication, and more systematic new terminology is introduced. New
sections are added that introduce novel issues or develop themes
raised in preceding essays. The concerns of the texts shift in ways
explicable by the need to cope with changing social and political
circumstances or to answer new philosophical challenges. Also, the
distinctive vocabulary of the longer essays tends to be concentrated
in sections of those texts that have no parallel in shorter essays,
suggesting that portions of the longer texts were modeled closely on
the older, shorter ones and then supplemented by newly composed
material. All these features of the texts seem best explained by the
theory that the books in each triad were composed in the sequence
upper-middle-lower.</p>

<p>

This chronological picture is of course compatible with the
possibility that the three broad strata &mdash; the three linguistically
identified groups of essays &mdash; were produced by different teams of
Mohist writers or editors, as Graham's version of the three factions
theory maintains. Indeed, the distinctive linguistic features of the
three groups make it extremely likely that they were composed by
different people. However, the first of the three groups may originally
have comprised as many as fourteen texts, and the third appears to have
included as few as four to six. There is no evidence that the
<em>Mozi</em> ever contained three complete sets of ten essays
ascribable to three different Mohist sects. Furthermore, internal
evidence suggests that the writers or editors of the second and third
groups of essays referred to the earlier groups of texts while
composing their own (Fraser forthcoming [b]; Maeder 1992), so if the
different groups of texts were produced by separate Mohist factions,
these factions were probably in close contact with each other.</p>

<p>

If correct, this hypothesis tends to cast doubt on Graham's suggestion
that the three series represent the views of three feuding Mohist
sects, a &ldquo;Purist&rdquo; group devoted to defending the true
teachings of Mozi and two politically power-hungry rivals, a
&ldquo;Compromiser&rdquo; faction that diluted the teachings and a
&ldquo;Reactionary&rdquo; wing that betrayed them (1989,
p. 53). Indeed, though the second and third series texts can perhaps
be read as moderating earlier doctrines in places, Graham's
characterization of the doctrinal tendencies of the three series is
too simplistic to be persuasive. For instance, the anti-war stance in
Book 28, which Graham classifies as &ldquo;reactionary,&rdquo; is if
anything more uncompromising than that in Book 18, his
&ldquo;purist&rdquo; anti-war text, since it is based on a moral
argument rather than only prudential and economic reasons. Nor is
&ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; an adequate label for the political theory
in Book 13, since it in fact handles the problem of authoritarian
abuse of power more effectively than the other two versions, by
specifying that the unifying moral code is to be based on &ldquo;care
and benefit&rdquo; for the clan, state, and world.</p>

<p>

To sum up, we can tentatively conclude that the significance of the
three versions of each doctrinal essay is primarily chronological: In
each triad, the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; essay appears to be of earlier
date than the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; essay, which in turn seems earlier
than the &ldquo;lower&rdquo; one. In addition, in at least four triads
and perhaps more, the division also relates to the essays' origin: The
&ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo;
essays were probably composed by different writers or editors. More
specifically, the essays fall into three linguistically distinct
groups, which are very likely of different origin. However, these
three groups do not coincide exactly with the division into
&ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo;
series and do not represent three complete series of ten essays,
attributable to three Mohist factions. The <em>Mozi</em> is in effect
an archive in which the compilers preserved a range of texts of
different origin and age, including both early essays and later essays
that on some doctrinal points probably superseded them.</p>

<p>

As to why exactly three essays on each doctrine were included &mdash;
not more, and not fewer &mdash; our evidence is so sparse that any
explanation is almost purely speculative. Graham's theory provides one
type of scenario. Another might be that the essays were composed by
different generations of Mohists, perhaps in different locations, who
by no means considered themselves followers of distinct, competing
factions. A third possibility is that the essays are a selection from
a wider pool of texts, which included a minimum of three on each
doctrine. Still another scenario, raised in passing by Maeder (1992),
is that some of the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; essays listed in the table of
contents never existed: Having three texts in hand for six of the ten
doctrines, the compilers left places for four more triads that
ultimately were never completely filled in. Given the paucity of
evidence, this sort of question about the origins of the triads may
never be answered.</p>
