<h2>Mackie's Arguments for the Moral Error Theory</h2>

<p>

<strong>The Argument from Relativity</strong> (often more
perspicaciously referred to as &ldquo;the Argument from
Disagreement&rdquo;) begins with an empirical observation: that there
is an enormous amount of variation in moral views, and that moral
disagreements are often characterized by an unusual degree of
intractability. Mackie argues that the best explanation of these
phenomena is that moral judgments &ldquo;reflect adherence to and
participation in different ways of life&rdquo; (1977: 36). This, at
least, is a better explanation than the hypothesis that there is a
realm of objective moral facts to which some cultures have inferior
epistemic access than others. The example Mackie uses is of two
cultures' divergent moral views regarding monogamy. Is it really
plausible, he asks, that one culture enjoys access to the moral facts
regarding marital arrangements whereas the other lacks that access?
Isn't it much more likely that monogamy happened to develop in one
culture but not in the other (for whatever cultural or anthropological
reasons), and that the respective moral views emerged <em>as a
result</em>?</p>

<p>

Opposition to the Argument from Relativity can, broadly speaking, take
two forms. First, one might deny the empirical premise, arguing that
moral disagreement is not really as widespread as it is often made out
to be, or at least arguing that much of the conspicuous disagreement
masks extensive moral <em>agreement</em> at a deeper level (a level
pertaining to more fundamental moral principles). Mackie makes some
brief remarks in response to this argument (1977: 37). Second, one
might accept the phenomenon of moral disagreement at face value but
deny that the best explanation of this favors the error theory. Often
both strategies are deployed side by side. For discussion, see Brink
1984; Shafer-Landau 1994; Loeb 1998; Lillehammer 2004; Tersman 2006;
Doris &amp; Plakias 2008.</p>

<p>

<strong>The Argument from Queerness</strong> has two strands: one
metaphysical and one epistemological. The first states that our
conception of a moral property is essentially one of a very unusual
kind of property, such that countenancing its instantiation requires
us to posit in the world &ldquo;qualities or relations of a very
strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the
universe&rdquo; (Mackie 1977: 38). The second states that in order to
track such weird properties we would need &ldquo;some special faculty
of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary
ways of knowing everything else&rdquo; (ibid.). These are not
independent arguments, since we are forced to posit weird
epistemological equipment only if it has already been established that
the properties in question are weird. Thus really it is the
metaphysical strand of the Argument from Queerness that is load
bearing.</p>

<p>

The Argument from Queerness may be taken to refer to Mackie's specific
version or may be considered in a generic sense. In the generic sense,
whenever one argues (A) that morality is centrally committed to some
thesis <em>X</em>, and (B) that <em>X</em> is bizarre, ontologically
profligate, or just too far-fetched to be taken seriously, etc., then
one has presented a kind of Argument from Queerness. (Arguments for
the moral error theory need not take this form; one might, for
example, simply discover that <em>X</em> is empirically false.) This
is generic since &ldquo;<em>X</em>&rdquo; could denote any of an
open-ended range of options. But even understanding the Argument from
Queerness in a non-generic sense is no straightforward matter, since
it is not entirely clear what Mackie intends to put in place of
&ldquo;<em>X</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Mackie says that for moral properties to exist would require the
existence of &ldquo;objective prescriptions,&rdquo; and it is
evidently these prescriptions that he finds metaphysically queer. He
claims that in denying the existence of such prescriptions he is
denying that any &ldquo;categorically imperative element is
objectively valid&rdquo; (1977: 29). A categorical imperative is an
imperative (&ldquo;Do &phi;&rdquo;) that is applied to a subject
irrespective of that person's ends. It is to be contrasted with a
hypothetical imperative, which does depend on a person's ends. Thus
&ldquo;Go to bed now&rdquo; is usually understood to be tacitly
conditional, depending on something like &ldquo;&hellip;if you want to
get a decent night's sleep.&rdquo; If it turns out that the person
lacks this desire (or any other desire that promises to be satisfied
by following the advice), then the imperative should be withdrawn. By
contrast, the categorical imperative &ldquo;Don't murder
children&rdquo; cannot be begged off by the addressee explaining that
he really enjoys murdering children, that he lacks any desires that
will be satisfied if the imperative is obeyed; it is not a <em>piece
of advice</em> at all. Note that it does not appear to be categorical
imperatives <em>per se</em> that trouble Mackie, but categorical
imperatives that purport to be &ldquo;objectively valid.&rdquo; Quite
what he means by this restriction, however, remains unclear.</p>

<p>

Mackie gives two concrete illustrations of what he has in
mind&mdash;of what the world would have to be like in order for these
putatively weird moral properties to be instantiated. First, he
mentions Plato's account of the Form of the Good, which is such that
the mere comprehension of the fact that something participates in the
Form (i.e., is good) somehow automatically engages the motivation to
seek that thing. The Good, for Plato, has a kind of magical magnetism
built into it. Second, Mackie mentions Samuel Clarke, who in the early
18th century argued for (in Mackie's words) &ldquo;necessary relations
of fitness between situations and actions, so that a situation would
have a demand for such-and-such an action somehow built into it&rdquo;
(1977: 40). The fact that these two illustrations are subtly but
importantly different is responsible for at least some of the
confusion surrounding the putative source of queerness. The Plato
example suggests that the weirdness resides in properties the
recognition of which <em>causally compels</em> motivation; the Clarke
example suggests that the weirdness resides in properties
that <em>demand</em> action (and thus motivation). The latter is
arguably the more charitable interpretation (see Garner 1990), and
also seems to fit better with comments made elsewhere by Mackie
concerning the role of practical <em>reasons</em> in the Argument from
Queerness. He writes that &ldquo;to say that [objective prescriptions]
are intrinsically action-guiding [which is one way Mackie sometimes
describes the queerness whose existence he is denying] is to say that
the reasons that they give for doing or for not doing something are
independent of that agent's desires or purposes&rdquo; (Mackie 1982:
115).</p>

<p>

It would make sense if Mackie were, then, simply to deny the existence
of such &ldquo;desire-transcendent&rdquo; reasons (like
Williams 1981); but his position is characteristically more nuanced
than this. He allows that we often legitimately employ talk of reasons
regarding persons who have no desires that will be satisfied by
performing the action in question. If some other people are suffering,
for example, and there is some course of action I can take to relieve
that suffering, then &ldquo;it would be natural,&rdquo; Mackie says,
to claim that these sufferings &ldquo;constitute some reason
... independent of any desire that I now have to help these other
people&rdquo; (1977: 78-9). Though Mackie doesn't attempt to discredit
appeals to such desire-transcendent reasons, what he does insist on is
that talk of such reasons is made legitimate only by the presence of
an <em>institution</em>: What allows the transition from &ldquo;There
is a stranger writhing in agony before me&rdquo; to &ldquo;I have a
reason to help&rdquo; is a cluster of institutional facts, not brute
facts. Examples of institutions, given by Mackie, include the rules of
chess, social practices such as promising, and the thoughts and
behaviors associated with the idea of a person's identity persisting
through time. Such institutions have rules of conduct which guide the
behavior and speech of adherents, and transgressions of which are
condemned. Importantly, such requirements &ldquo;are constituted by
human thought, behaviour, feelings, and attitudes&rdquo; (1977: 81),
and thus any such requirements are, in a central
sense, <em>mind-dependent</em>. This, perhaps, provides insight into
why Mackie objects not to categorical imperatives <em>per se</em>, but
to <em>objective</em> categorical imperatives: It is categorical
imperatives that profess to transcend all institutions, that purport
to depend for their legitimacy on &ldquo;requirements which simply are
there, in the nature of things&rdquo; (1977: 59), that are singled out
as erroneous. As with categorical imperatives, so with reasons: It may
not be false to claim &ldquo;Anyone has a reason to ease the suffering
of others,&rdquo; but its truth is guaranteed only by invoking an
institutional way of speaking&mdash;an institution of which one
may <em>or may not</em> be an adherent. (Mackie writes that one is
never &ldquo;logically committed&rdquo; to offer allegiance to an
institution.) It is only when such a reason claim purports to
transcend all institutions&mdash;when it is imbued with ambitions of
objectivity&mdash;that it oversteps the mark.</p>

<p>

In light of these observations, the error theory arises because
(Mackie thinks) moral discourse is pervaded through and through with
aspirations to robust, institution-transcendent prescriptivity. To some
extent he considers that this is due to a natural human projectivist
tendency (1977: 42), but he also thinks that the problematic notions
of &ldquo;what is intrinsically fitting or required by the nature of
things&rdquo; are in part the product of institutional thinking, and
thus so too are the concepts of value, obligation, and reasons that
depend on these notions (1977: 82). However, this does not mean that
these notions and concepts are institutional <em>in content</em>; the
idea of an institution-transcendent requirement is not shown to be any
less erroneous, Mackie thinks, if we observe that the idea grew out
of, and remains supported by, a widely accepted institution.</p>

2008; Bedke 2010; Olson 2014. Several papers in Joyce &amp; Kirchin
2010 directly discuss the argument from queerness.</p>
