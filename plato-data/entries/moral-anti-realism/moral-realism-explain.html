<h2>Moral Anti-realism vs. Realism: Explanatory Power</h2>

<p>

It is widely accepted that so long as a metaethical theory is coherent
and not ontologically profligate, its value is to be measured by its
ability to explain a certain range of phenomena. (Some will accept a
modest increase in ontological extravagance in return for
proportionally greater explanatory strength.) This range is
ill-defined and open-ended, but is typically taken to consist of such
things as the manifest features of moral language, the importance of
morality in our lives, moral practices and institutions, the way moral
considerations engage motivation, the character of moral disagreement,
and the acquisition of moral attitudes. In practice, however, there
remains dispute concerning what the phenomena are that a metaethical
theory should be expected to explain. Even when some such phenomenon
is roughly agreed upon, there is significant divergence over its exact
nature. For example, pretty much everyone agrees that any decent
metaethical theory should be able to explain the close connection
between moral judgment and motivation&mdash;but it is a live question
whether that connection should be construed as a <em>necessary</em>
one, or whether a reliably contingent connection will suffice. (See
Svavard&oacute;ttir 1999.) Even when such disputes can be settled,
there remains plenty of room for arguing over whether a given theory
does indeed adequately explain the phenomenon. For example, it is
often taken for granted that noncognitivism is well placed to account
for the (putative) necessary connection between moral judgment and
motivation, but arguably this is not true (Joyce 2002). Given
this level of open-endedness and disagreement about the match between
any given metaethical theory and the range of phenomena it is supposed
to explain, a great deal of the work in metaethics can be interpreted
as rival theories jockeying to shift explanatory burdens of proof onto
opponents.</p>

<p>

On certain matters relevant to the moral realist/anti-realist debate,
it would seem that some such challenges are accepted by both
parties. Consider, for example, moral language. Moral predicates
appear to function linguistically like any other predicate: Just as
the sentence &ldquo;The cat is brown&rdquo; may be used as an
antecedent of a conditional, as a premise of an argument, as the basis
of a question (&ldquo;Is the cat brown?&rdquo;), have its predicate
nominalized (&ldquo;Brownness is had by the cat&rdquo;), be embedded
in a propositional attitude claim (&ldquo;Mary believes that the cat
is brown&rdquo;), and have the truth predicate applied to it
(&ldquo;&lsquo;The cat is brown&rsquo; is true&rdquo;)&mdash;so too
can all these things be done, without obvious incoherence, with a
moral sentence like &ldquo;Stealing is wrong.&rdquo; For the moral
cognitivist&mdash;who argues that moral predicates are no different,
logically or grammatically, from any other common-or-garden
predicates&mdash;there is no puzzle here. But the moral noncognitivist
who argues that moral predicates function differently from ordinary
predicates&mdash;that they are not <em>logically</em> predicates at
all&mdash;appears to face a special challenge. The noncognitivist
often acknowledges this, accepting that on this matter she does indeed
bear a burden of proof. (Note, though, that this doesn't imply that
the moral realist as such enjoys a prima facie dialectical advantage,
for the error theorist and the non-objectivist would gain the same
advantage over the noncognitivist.)</p>

<p>

However, if this noncognitivist can demonstrate that
regarding <em>other</em> phenomena it is the cognitivist who faces the
special challenge, then, ceteris paribus, matters are less clear. The
noncognitivist C.L. Stevenson, for example, sought to draw attention
to unusual features of moral disagreement, marking it as distinct from
disagreement about factual matters (1944, 1963 essays 1 &amp; 2). The
intractability and bitterness of many moral disputes, in Stevenson's
opinion, speak in favor of the proposition that such disputes involve
the clash of emotions, and that the utterances therein function to
express the speaker's own emotion while serving her desire to
influence those of the audience. This is, in effect, a burden of proof
argument against the cognitivist: observing a phenomenon (that moral
disputes are emotive, rhetorical, obstinate, etc.) the explanation of
which poses no problem for a certain brand of noncognitivism, but for
which the cognitivist has to work to provide.</p>

<p>

There is little to be gained by keeping a tally of such arguments and
counter-arguments in the hope of determining who <em>overall</em>
bears the greater burden of proof, for there is no reason to assume
that the explanations of the phenomena are all on a
par. Theory <em>X</em> may explain a greater number of phenomena
than <em>Y</em> (to the extent that such things can be numerically
distinguished), but perhaps the phenomena that <em>Y</em> does the
better job of explaining are more important, pressing, or
valuable.</p>

<p>

Stepping back from the moral cognitivist/noncognitivist debate to the
more general moral realist/anti-realist debate, can we detect a
pattern in the dialectic indicating that burden of proof exercises of
this kind <em>generally</em> favor one side over the other? It is
doubtful that an impartial observer would discern one. Although there
is a widespread assumption in the metaethical literature that moral
realism enjoys a prima facie advantage, the assumed advantage lies
largely in the realm of <em>intuition</em> (the topic
of <a href="moral-realism-intuitive.html">supplement 2.1</a>); but if
the goal is not to <em>vindicate</em> intuition, but rather to provide
the best explanation of a range of observable moral phenomena (which
may include facts about what intuitions people hold), then the
realist's advantage is much less obvious. </p>

<p>

The question of whether moral realism enjoys an explanatory advantage
over anti-realism is in part a question of whether objective moral
facts are needed to explain anything. A relevant debate in modern
metaethics is that between Gilbert Harman (1977, 1986) and Nicholas
Sturgeon (1985, 1986). Harman raises the possibility that there exists
no phenomenon for which an appeal to moral facts is a necessary
element of the best explanation. Sturgeon denies this, citing such
phenomena as Hitler's actions (in part explained by
his <em>depravity</em>) and a political revolution (explained in part
by the <em>injustices</em> perpetrated by the overthrown regime).</p>

<p>

The Harman/Sturgeon debate is complex and widely misunderstood. (See
Tropman 2013.) Harman's ultimate position is <em>not</em> that there
are no moral facts; indeed, he explicitly asserts &ldquo;there is
empirical evidence that there are (relational) moral facts&rdquo;
(1977: 132). His intention is to issue a challenge: that those who
believe in moral facts owe skeptics a plausible account of how the
moral facts that are cited in realist explanations (e.g., concerning
depravity and injustice) relate to those non-moral facts that seem
otherwise adequate to explain any phenomena. This account must also
clarify how we enjoy epistemic access to these moral facts and why
they seem of such practical importance to us. Harman suspects that
such an account (which he calls a &ldquo; reduction&rdquo;) may in
fact be forthcoming (see his 1986: 65), but the point relevant to our
current purposes is his contention that the believer in moral facts
has extra work to do in order to establish her position; thus this may
be interpreted as an attempt establish a burden of proof.</p>

<p>

Note, however, that the debate between Harman and Sturgeon concerns
the existence of moral facts, not the existence of mind-independent
moral facts. Thus it is possible to side with Sturgeon in this debate
while rejecting moral realism. This is what non-objectivists
do. (Harman himself falls into this category.) Thus, although Harman's
challenge can be seen as an attempt to place the burden of proof on
the shoulders of those who believe in moral facts, it is not to be
mistaken for an attempt to place that burden on the moral realist as
such. Even if Harman succeeds in establishing this burden of proof
case, the moral realist will suffer no particular handicap
vis-&agrave;-vis the moral non-objectivist.</p>

<p>

But further arguments might be brought forward to show that the moral
realist starts off on the back foot. Why, after all, might one think (like Harman)
that there is something especially <em>difficult</em> about showing
how moral facts relate to the non-moral items that figure in good
explanations of observable phenomena? Broadly speaking, it is because
moral facts are assumed to have qualities that it
is prima facie challenging to integrate into the naturalistic causal
world order. Mackie thinks that moral
normativity is characterized by a kind of &ldquo;objective
prescriptivity&rdquo;&mdash;which he describes as the property of
providing agents with practical reasons independent of the agent's
desires or purposes (1982: 115; see also Joyce 2001; Olson
2014)&mdash;and because he doubts that anything has this property, he
doubts that moral normativity exists (see section 4 of main entry and
supplement thereof). Harman agrees that the normativity in question
must involve the provision of practical reasons (1977: ch. 10-11),
but, unlike Mackie, he is willing to countenance the identification of moral facts
with reasons that
have their source in the agent's &ldquo;aims and goals&rdquo; (1977:
133)&mdash;i.e., that are &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;
reasons. As to the possibility of &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
reasons&mdash;ones that do not ultimately depend on an agent's
ends&mdash;(a view that both Harman and Mackie attribute to Kant),
Harman is doubtful. Thus, he thinks that when it comes to moral
theories that identify moral facts with reason facts, the moral
non-objectivist has a distinct advantage over the moral objectivist. He
writes: &ldquo;The burden of proof is on Kant to show how reason could
have the powers he attributes to it [i.e., of issuing reasons (moral
imperatives) derived from the intrinsic nature of reason alone]; and
so far neither Kant nor anyone else has been able to show this&rdquo;
(1977: 133). (For more on &ldquo;objective reasons,&rdquo; see
Korsgaard 1986, 1996; Markovitz 2010; Heuer
2010.) </p>

<p>

To clarify: One can locate two places in Harman's argument where
burden-of-proof matters arise. First, he thinks that the believer in
moral facts bears a special burden: Given the apparent possibility
that any phenomenon may be satisfactorily explained without recourse
to an appeal to moral facts, the onus is on the believer in such facts
to clarify persuasively how they fit into the causal world order. This
is a burden that Harman thinks can probably be discharged. (The amount
of confidence he expresses in this possibility seems to fluctuate.)
The account of moral facts that he finds most promising is one that
identifies moral facts with reason facts. However, whereas a theory of
reasons that conceives of them as depending centrally on the agent's
interests seems to Harman to be both empirical and &ldquo;not
particularly problematic&rdquo; (1977: 131), a theory of reasons that
supposes them to be entirely independent of any agent's
interests&mdash;that is, potentially a form of
moral <em>realism</em>&mdash;is prima facie puzzling, and thus owes
its opponents a detailed defense. Harman makes clear his doubt that
this second burden of proof can be discharged.</p>

<p>

But does the realist <em>accept</em> this burden? (As noted earlier,
the mere <em>assertion</em> that one's opponent bears a burden of
proof is cheap; we're interested in the situation where one side in
the debate willingly shoulders the burden.) Not necessarily. It is
open to the moral realist to complain that both Harman and Mackie have lumbered morality with unnecessarily weird
qualities, and it is because they do this that the problem of how
moral normativity fits within the naturalistic world order seems so
prima facie puzzling. (See, for example, Tresan 2009 and Baeten 2012
for this form of argument deployed against Joyce's error theoretic
argument.) A certain kind of utilitarian moral realist, for example,
simply <em>identifies</em> moral rightness with the property of
maximizing overall happiness, and may then claim that there's nothing
particularly metaphysically or epistemologically puzzling
about <em>that</em> property. The burden then falls back to the
anti-realist to say what is inadequate about the utilitarian's
offering. Or a moral realist may pursue a &ldquo;partners in
innocence&rdquo; strategy: drawing attention to other kinds of
seemingly &ldquo;objective normativity&rdquo;&mdash;e.g.,
epistemological normativity or logical normativity&mdash;observing
that few harbor skeptical doubts about there being facts concerning,
say, what one ought to believe (given other beliefs) or what one ought
to deduce (given certain premises). (See Cuneo 2007; Bedke 2010.)
Again, the intention is to push the burden back on the moral
anti-realist to articulate a reasoned distinction between the
objective moral facts, which are deemed problematic, and the other
kinds of objective normative facts, which supposedly are not. </p>
