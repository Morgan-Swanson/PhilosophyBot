<h2>Moral Anti-realism vs. Realism: Intuitions</h2>

<p>

It is widely assumed that commonsense intuitions favor moral realism,
and thus that anti-realists bear the burden of proof. But neither this
assumption nor its presumed implication is something to be accepted
without careful consideration. Certainly nobody should claim as
a <em>general</em> methodological principle that realism enjoys a
prima facie advantage over anti-realism, for there are many things
with respect to which we all want to be anti-realists, but for which
we do not think this status has been achieved only after overcoming
initial realist presumptions (e.g., anti-realism about
unicorns). Rather, the thought must be that morality in particular is
such that realism is the more intuitive position. But whether this
thought is reasonable is debatable.</p>

<p>

First: Do commonsense intuitions really favor moral realism? It seems
probable that many of the distinctions drawn in distinguishing one
metaethical option from another are too fine-grained and abstruse for
the folk to have any determinate opinion. It is, for example,
radically unclear to what extent common sense grants prima facie
privilege to the mind-independent status of moral facts (properties,
etc.). Even if empirical investigation of collective opinion were to
locate strong intuitions in favor of a mind-independent morality (see,
for example, Goodwin &amp; Darley 2008), there may be other equally
robust intuitions in favor of morality being
mind-<em>dependent</em>. (For example, the fact that we are unwilling
to defer to experts when forming moral views seems to count against
realism; see McGrath 2008. Similarly, the fact that we do not expect a
person necessarily to accept others' reasons for their moral views
seems to reveal anti-realistic tendencies; see Foot 1958 for
discussion.) Such an indecisive outcome may be due to human intuition
having the ability to discriminate subtly different (in)dependence
relations, or due to subjects' responses being subject to various
kinds of framing effect in the experimental protocol (see, e.g.,
Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Horowitz 1998), or due simply to human
intuitions being confused. Moreover, even if it could be shown that
human intuition clearly and decisively embraces some kind of
coarse-grained moral mind-independence, it may be that certain
theoretical versions of mind-<em>dependence</em>, as described by
philosophers, are sufficiently devious and obscure that they do not
clash with that commonsense intuition. For example, although common
sense certainly seems to be flatly at odds with any kind of crass
individualistic relativistic non-objectivism according to which any
individual's moral opinions (no matter how whimsical) determine the
moral facts (for her), it is less obvious that common sense will
reject a form of non-objectivism according to which the moral facts are
determined by the opinions that would be formed by an impartial, fully
reflective, fully informed (etc.) spectator. Given the difficulties in
deciding and articulating just what kind of (in)dependence relation is
relevant to the moral realism/anti-realism division, and given the
range and potential subtlety of options, it would be rash to claim
that common sense has a clear opinion one way or the other on this
matter.</p>

<p>

Second: It may be questioned whether intuitions decisively in favor of
moral realism (if any there are) would constitute a burden of proof
for the anti-realist. Certainly there seems something suspect about
making it a methodological principle that if most people believe
something there is a presumption in favor of the truth of that
belief. (For advocacy of this principle for the moral realm, see Lycan
1988 and Huemer 2005. For criticism of the latter, see Joyce
2009<em>a</em>.) The fact that atheism is a minority position in every
modern nation does not typically move the atheist to acknowledge a
mark against her view. The fact that most people expect a rock dropped
from the mast of a moving ship to land some distance behind the base
of the mast plays <em>no role</em> in the physicist's calculations
about where it will in fact land; the physicist has no <em>prima
facie</em> obligation to make his theory mesh with intuition. Whether
some kind of initial stock should be placed in favor of human
intuition depends very much on how smart we antecedently expect humans
to be, but this expectation alters for different domains. We don't
expect ordinary people to be particularly insightful about the
behavior of subatomic particles. As for religious
views, <em>wherever</em> one stands (atheist, Hindu, Christian,
scientologist, etc.) one must credit millions or billions of humans
with radically false fundamental beliefs. (One might object that many
religious belief systems are really unified&mdash;that Hinduism and
Christianity, for example, are not contraries&mdash;but then there are
millions or billions of humans who disagree with <em>that</em>.)
Knowing that humans can be massively and systematically mistaken
encourages the moral anti-realist to deny that popular opinion in
favor of moral realism would constitute a burden he needs to
overcome.</p>

<p>

In wondering about what role should be accorded to widespread
intuitions against a philosophical thesis, it is important to
distinguish between the status of such intuitions ex ante and ex
post. Suppose, if only for the sake of argument, that it is a
reasonable methodological principle that, prior to considering any
evidence or reflecting on the matter, a widespread intuition in favor
of some view accords it some prima facie epistemological
privilege. Suppose (again, for the sake of argument) that this is the
case regarding moral realism. However, once the moral anti-realist has
deployed, to his own satisfaction, some arguments in favor of his
viewpoint, then he may consider himself to have discharged the burden,
and the sociological fact that people continue to regard his view as
counter-intuitive cannot be legitimately raised as an ongoing
consideration against it. One way that this burden may be discharged
is if the anti-realist is able to <em>explain away</em> what he takes
to be the erroneous views of the folk. If he can provide a genealogy
of moral beliefs&mdash;a genealogy that nowhere implies or presupposes
that the beliefs in question are <em>true</em>&mdash;if, moreover,
this genealogy can receive some empirical confirmation (for it will,
after all, be an <em>a posteriori</em> matter)&mdash;then he will have
discharged whatever ex ante burden he may have faced. (For this kind
of genealogical debunking argument against moral realism, see Ruse
1986 and Street 2006. See also Joyce 2006, 2013.) The moral anti-realist position
will continue to be counter-intuitive, but these ongoing intuitions no
longer represent a consideration against the theory. If ever these
intuitions did (ex ante) represent such a consideration, then in
providing a genealogy of the kind in question the anti-realist will
have answered the charge. The moral realist can, of course, raise
objections to the anti-realist's argument&mdash;protesting, for
example, that the genealogy in question is not consistent with
falsehood in the way that the anti-realist claims it is. (See, for
example, Wielenberg 2010; Brosnan 2011.) The point is, however, that
this represents a shift in the dialectic; the moral realist is no
longer merely citing the counter-intuitiveness of moral anti-realism
as a consideration.</p>

<p>

It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish ex ante matters from ex
post. Consider John Mackie's moral error theory. Mackie holds that
moral judgment is the result of the human tendency to
&ldquo;objectify&rdquo; our parochial emotions and preferences, and
through this process coming to see the world as containing evaluative
properties which it does not in fact contain (Mackie 1977:
42-46). (Thus, Mackie is a moral projectivist, which is a thesis
discussed at further length in supplement 3.1.) The important thing to
note here about Mackie's notion of &ldquo;objectification&rdquo; is
that it implies a thesis of moral phenomenology: It <em>seems</em> to
someone who is making the moral judgment that she is responding to
moral facts present in the external world (whereas in fact she is
causally active in the generation of her moral experience). (See Joyce
2009<em>b</em>, 2010.) Given this thesis of moral
phenomenology&mdash;that it is imbued with a quality of
&ldquo;out-there-ness&rdquo;&mdash;and assuming (as seems plausible)
that our moral intuitions will line up with our moral experience, it
follows that the theory of moral objectification will be deemed
counter-intuitive. But if the thesis of moral objectification
is <em>ex hypothesi</em> counter-intuitive, then that
counter-intuitiveness cannot be raised as a dialectic consideration
against the theory. It is difficult to decide whether (i) this
projectivist thesis indicates that the counter-intuitiveness of the
moral error theory is not even an ex ante mark against the theory, or
(ii) it's a case of the error theorist discharging that <em>prima
facie</em> burden by presenting an argument to show that the folk will
find the theory counter-intuitive. This delicate matter is not
something to be pursued further here.</p>

<p>

Summary:</p>

<p>

The question of whether something is a widespread intuition (within a
specified group, or among humans in general) is an empirical
matter. With respect to the intuitions relevant to the moral realism
debate, such questions have not, by and large, been appropriately
examined. (For initial investigations, see Goodwin &amp; Darley 2008;
Sarkissian et al. 2011.) On many crucial matters&mdash;matters that
determine the difference between moral anti-realism being true or
false&mdash;there may be no position enjoying the support of
collective intuition; the issues may simply be too analytical and
abstruse. But even if widespread intuitions were to be located, it is
not at all obvious what methodological weight should be accorded them,
especially in light of the fact that it is a corollary of certain
anti-realist metaethical theories that erroneous intuitions will be
prevalent.</p>
