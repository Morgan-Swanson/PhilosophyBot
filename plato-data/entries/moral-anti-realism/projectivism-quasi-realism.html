<h2>Projectivism and Quasi-realism</h2>

<p>

Simon Blackburn is considered a noncognitivist, a projectivist, and a
quasi-realist. These are distinct positions, and it is aim of this
supplement to distinguish them. First it should be noted that
Blackburn himself does not necessarily agree with this classificatory
system. He has often made efforts to eschew the label
&ldquo;noncognitivist&rdquo; (see Blackburn 1996), and on one occasion
opines that &ldquo;projectivism&rdquo; is not an entirely happy term
for his position (1995: 36) (though he uses it freely). We can at
least be confident in calling him a &ldquo;quasi-realist,&rdquo; since
this is a term he invented for the position he advocates. This noted,
for the sake of convenience in what follows I shall speak as if
Blackburn espouses all three positions.</p>

<p>

Projectivism is best thought of as a causal account of moral
experience. Consider a straightforward, observation-based moral
judgment: Jane sees two youths hurting a cat and thinks &ldquo;That is
impermissible.&rdquo; The causal story begins with a real event in the
world: two youths performing actions, a suffering cat, etc. Then there
is Jane's sensory perception of this event (she sees the youths, hears
the cat's howls, etc.). Jane may form certain inferential beliefs
concerning, say, the youths' intentions, the cats' pain, etc. All this
prompts in Jane an emotion: <em>she disapproves</em> (say). She then
&ldquo;projects&rdquo; this emotion onto her experience of the world,
which results in her judging the action to
be <em>impermissible</em>. In David Hume's words: &ldquo;taste [as
opposed to reason] has a productive faculty, and gilding and staining
all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal
sentiment, raises in a manner a new creation&rdquo; (Hume [1751] 1983:
88). Here, <em>impermissibility</em> is the &ldquo;new
creation.&rdquo; This is not to say that Jane &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the
action to instantiate impermissibility in the same way as she sees the
cat to instantiate brownness; but she judges the world to contain a
certain quality, and her doing so is not the product of her tracking a
real feature of the world, but is, rather, prompted by an emotional
experience.</p>

<p>

Putting aside any doubts about the plausibility or even coherence of
projectivism, what relation does it bear to noncognitivism? Even if we
construe noncognitivism in a mentalistic manner&mdash;as a thesis
concerning what kind of mental states moral judgments are&mdash;there
is no obvious implication relation. Although an emotional episode is a
central component of the whole projectivist chain of events, it
doesn't follow that the moral judgment must (or should) be identified
with that component. Projectivism, after all, implies an account of
moral <em>phenomenology</em>: It implies that moral properties appear
as if they are in the world. Perhaps sometimes we know better; perhaps
sometimes although we cannot help but experience the world as
containing some quality, we don't believe that it really does (just as
we know that the stick in the water is straight although we cannot
help but see it as bent). But it is widely accepted by projectivists
that often we <em>don't</em> know better&mdash;that we are taken in by
our own projectivist tendencies.  And if this is so, then it is
natural to assume that ultimately Jane <em>believes</em> that the
action is impermissible: Her emotional projection results in a
belief. And since this belief is at least as good a candidate as the
emotion for being identified as the moral judgment, projectivism is
perfectly compatible with cognitivism (understood as a thesis
concerning what kinds of mental states moral judgments are). (See
Joyce 2009<em>b</em>.)</p>

<p>

The same argument holds, mutatis mutandis, if we choose to
characterize noncognitivism as a thesis concerning sentences or speech
acts. Since we can assume that the language with which people discuss
moral matters will reflect their experience, then when they say things
like &ldquo;Hurting that cat is impermissible&rdquo; we can assume
that they are asserting that the situation instantiates this property
(the property that they have in fact projected onto their
experience). But if they are <em>asserting</em> such things&mdash;that
is, expressing their beliefs on the matter&mdash;then they cannot
simply be expressing their emotions.</p>

<p>

It is also possible to accept the projectivist account of moral
experience while identifying <em>impermissibility</em> (say) with some
feature of the world: say, the &ldquo;power&rdquo; (to use an
old-fashioned Lockean term) to prompt a certain response in the
viewer. According to such a view, when Jane utters the sentence
&ldquo;Hurting that cat is impermissible&rdquo; what she is doing is
best interpreted as asserting that the act of hurting the cat has the
power to prompt a certain kind of emotional response in her (or in
some person in specifiable ideal circumstances). One might even hold
that she should be interpreted as asserting that the act of hurting
the cat has the power to prompt a certain act of emotional
projection. And since the act may indeed have this property, her
assertion may be true. Whether this will count as a form of <em>moral
realism</em> depends on how we choose to specify the relevant
(in)dependency relation between moral facts and our mental activity
(to be discussed in section 5 of main entry). But certainly on some
such specifications this will count as a form of moral realism. Thus
not only is it a mistake to think that projectivism is the province
solely of the noncognitivist; it would be equally mistaken to assume
that it is the province solely of the moral anti-realist. (See Craig
2000 for an argument for the compatibility of projectivism and realism
in Hume's views on causality. See also Sainsbury 1998.)</p>

<p>

Blackburn is not only a noncognitivist and a moral projectivist, but a
quasi-realist. (See also Gibbard 2003.) Quasi-realism is best thought
of not as a philosophical position but as a philosophical
<em>program</em>. The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an
anti-realist metaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical
maneuvering, to <em>earn the right</em> for moral discourse to enjoy
all the trappings of realist talk. Such a view may hold that although
the underlying logical structure of the sentence &ldquo;Stealing is
wrong&rdquo; is nothing more than &ldquo;Stealing: Boo!&rdquo;, it is
still legitimate for ordinary speakers to use such language as
&ldquo;Fred believes that stealing is wrong,&rdquo; &ldquo;If stealing
is wrong, then so is borrowing without permission,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stealing would remain wrong regardless of what anyone thought
of it,&rdquo; &ldquo;The sentence &lsquo;Stealing is wrong&rsquo; is
true,&rdquo; and even, perhaps, &ldquo;The property of wrongness is
instantiated by stealing.&rdquo; Blackburn (1993<em>a</em>: 184-6)
identifies two types of quasi-realism: the fast track and the slow
track.</p>

<p>

Fast track quasi-realism begins by earning the right for the truth
predicate to be applied to moral sentences, and then observes that
once the legitimacy of the truth predicate is established much (all?)
other realist talk comes along for free. Thus, for example, once it is
allowed that &ldquo;Stealing is wrong&rdquo; may be considered true or
false&mdash;in virtue of nothing more than its surface propositional
grammar (even though it really means nothing more than
&ldquo;Stealing: Boo!&rdquo;), then there is no special problem
associated with this sentence appearing as the antecedent of a
conditional.</p>

<p>

Slow track quasi-realism, by contrast, doesn't attempt to earn the
right to realist talk all in one fell swoop (via establishing the
legitimacy of the truth predicate), but rather seeks to demonstrate
the acceptability of different types of apparently realist talk in a
more piecemeal fashion. Thus the slow track quasi-realist will devote
energy to showing how sentences taking the form of interjections
(e.g., &ldquo;Stealing: Boo!&rdquo;) may still function very much like
antecedents of conditionals (and thus as premises of valid
arguments). This project has seen Blackburn undertake the convoluted
task of establishing a special logic of interjections&mdash;one which
mirrors the regular logic of proposition-stating sentences. (See also
Weintraub 2011.)</p>

<p>

One may wonder why, if fast track quasi-realism promises to succeed,
the piecemeal approach of the slow track is also
necessary&mdash;especially given that the latter is (it is agreed by
all hands) the more intimidating project. Blackburn's answer is that
the two approaches can play off each other in a mutually beneficial
way. Results from the slow lane contribute to establishing the
principal objective of the fast track: to earn the right to the use of
the truth predicate in reference to moral sentences. &ldquo;Fast-track
quasi-realism can benefit from the security provided by
slow-track&rdquo; (Blackburn 1993<em>a</em>: 197).</p>

<p>

One of the main challenges for the quasi-realist is to maintain a
theoretic distance from the moral realist. If the quasi-realist
program succeeds in vindicating the use of the truth predicate for
moral sentences, if it in addition makes it permissible to say
&ldquo;It is a fact that stealing is wrong,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a
mind-independent fact that stealing is wrong,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stealing
would be wrong even if our attitude toward it were different,&rdquo;
and so on&mdash;mimicking all and any of the moral realist's
assertions&mdash;then in what sense is
quasi-realism <em>quasi</em>-realism?&mdash;Why has it not simply
collapsed into the robust moral realism that it set out to oppose?
(See Wright 1988<em>a</em>; Dreier 2004; Lewis 2005; Asay 2013.)</p>

<p>

Because Blackburn is classified as all three&mdash;a moral
noncognitivist, a moral projectivist, and a moral
quasi-realist&mdash;and because he has had such an influence on recent
metaethics, these terms have become somewhat confused in certain
quarters. It is important to recognize the significant independence of
all of them. One can be a noncognitivist without being either a
projectivist or a quasi-realist; one can be a projectivist without
being either a noncognitivist or a quasi-realist; and one can be a
quasi-realist without being either a noncognitivist or a
projectivist. Only the last might legitimately raise an eyebrow, given
Blackburn's characterization of quasi-realism as &ldquo;the enterprise
of explaining why our discourse has the shape it does &hellip; if
projectivism is true&rdquo; (1984: 180), which would appear to make it
true by definition that all quasi-realists are projectivists. This may
well be so, but there are a couple of reasons for hesitating. First,
Blackburn has a distinctive and somewhat idiosyncratic understanding
of <em>projectivism</em>, so there are certain philosophical paradigms
of projectivism that his claim is not intended to cover (see Joyce
2009<em>b</em>). Second, there would be nothing obviously
objectionable (perhaps not even anything that Blackburn would object
to) in broadening quasi-realism into the project of earning the right
to realist talk from <em>any anti-realist starting point</em>&mdash;in
which case quasi-realism could be a program undertaken by, say, an
error theorist. Such a program would endeavor to explain why it might
remain acceptable for self-aware error theorists to retain their
realist-seeming moral discourse. On this classificatory scheme, a
certain kind of fictionalism counts as a form of quasi-realism. (There
has been some debate over the converse: whether quasi-realism is a
form of fictionalism. See Lewis 2005; Blackburn 2005; Jenkins
2006.)</p>
