<h1>Justice, Inequality, and Health</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Dec 23, 2008; substantive revision Wed Aug 27, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p> Among American men, there is a 15.4 year difference in life
expectancy between Asians and high-risk urban blacks, where these
groups constitute, respectively, the best-off and worst-off groups of
men in the &lsquo;eight Americas&rsquo; analysis of mortality in the
United States by Murray and colleagues (2006).  Among American women,
the corresponding difference in life expectancy is 12.8 years,
although the worst-off group of women is low-income southern rural
blacks (&lsquo;America 7&rsquo;) rather than high-risk urban blacks
(&lsquo;America 8&rsquo;).  On the face of it, these inequalities in
American life expectancy are seriously unjust.</p>

<p>

If one turns to the international context, inequalities in life
expectancy of a similar magnitude can be observed even between the
worst-off countries and the global average: In 2011, life expectancy
in 19 countries was 15 years or more below the global life expectancy
of 70 years; and this global average was itself 13 years below life
expectancy in Japan and Switzerland, which had the highest national
averages of all (WHO 2013, Table 1).</p>

<p>

But whether the appearances of injustice here will withstand close
scrutiny is a separate question.  Not all inequalities in life
expectancy seem unjust.  For example, in 2010, life expectancy for all
American women was 80.9 years, whereas for all American men it was
only 76.3 years (Wang et al., 2013). Presumably, little (if any) of
this 4.6 year inequality in life expectancy represents an
injustice. However, if some inequalities in health are not unjust,
then inequalities in health are not unjust <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>

So what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do
<em>health</em> inequalities have some significance in justice that
differs from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an
unjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general
principles of equality and justice to the case of health?</p>

<p>

To answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different
literatures. On the one hand, there is an empirical literature
concerning the underlying determinants of health and, on the other
hand, there is a philosophical literature concerned with the ethics of
population health. The former literature is considerably more
extensive and developed than the latter. Even there, however, the
answers on offer are hardly complete or fully established.</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

Intuitively, if a given inequality in life expectancy is inevitable,
then it is not <em>unjust</em>. A plausible necessary condition, that
is, on a particular inequality's being unjust is that the
inequality in question is avoidable. To the extent, for example, that
some biological necessity underlies the widely observed inequality in
life expectancy between men and women, this particular gender
inequality in health does not qualify as an injustice. (Indeed, Sen
1992 famously relies upon an estimate of some such biologically
necessary inequality, as part of an argument criticizing the treatment
of women in countries where the inequality in life expectancy actually
favours <em>men</em>). A first step, therefore, in analysing the
possible injustice of an inequality in health is to establish that the
inequality is avoidable. This, in turn, requires some understanding of
the underlying <em>determinants</em> (or causes) of health.</p>

<p>

More specifically, it requires an understanding of the subset of
determinants of health that are socially controllable. Some very
important determinants of health &mdash; notably, biology and luck
&mdash; are not socially controllable; and precisely for that reason,
inequalities in health caused by biology or luck are unavoidable (and
hence, not unjust). Most of the empirical literature concentrates on
what are known as &lsquo;the social determinants&rsquo; of health. In
this context, a <em>social determinant</em> of health is a socially
controllable factor outside the traditional health care system that is
an independent partial cause of an individual's health
status. Candidate examples include income, education, occupational
rank, and social class.</p>

<p>
Health care (personal medical care and public health) is clearly an
additional socially controllable determinant of health.  Nevertheless,
for different reasons, in both the empirical and the philosophical
literatures, health care is something of a separate
topic. Accordingly, we shall touch on it only briefly. In the public
health literature, variations in access to health care are not
regarded as a significant contributor to inequalities in health. (For
a brief corrective against the natural tendency to reserve a
privileged position for health care here, see Marmot and Wilkinson
1999, ch. 1). But to recognise that there are social determinants of
health, in the sense we have defined, is not to deny the importance of
health care as another partial cause.</p>

<p> Whether universal access to health care reduces inequalities in
health significantly or not, there is a widespread conviction that it
is a requirement of justice. Indeed, the development of a rationale
for universal access to health care (as a requirement of justice) has
been the traditional focus of philosophical reflection on health and
justice. The most well-known rationale is the equality of opportunity
argument developed by Norman Daniels (1985; 2008).  On this argument,
an individual's entitlement to health care rests on the instrumental
contribution that good health makes to preserving her fair share of
opportunity. Since Daniels' rationale does ultimately turn on the
claim that universal access reduces inequalities in health, it is open
to empirical criticism on this point (Sreenivasan 2001; 2007a).</p>

<p>

Another prominent rationale is the prudent insurance argument (Dworkin
2000, ch. 8; Gibbard 1984). Here the individual's entitlement to
health care rests on the proposition that, under certain idealized
conditions, it would be prudentially rational of her to spend some of
her fair share of income on a decent minimum of health care
insurance. A third rationale for universal access to health care has
been offered by Allen Buchanan (1984). His argument has two
distinctive features. On the one hand, it allows the justification for
providing an individual with health care to vary across
individuals&mdash;<em>universal</em> coverage is justified by
stitching together a patchwork quilt, as it were, of different
justifications. On the other hand, it eschews egalitarian premises
(there is no appeal to a &lsquo;fair share&rsquo; of
anything)&mdash;in fact, its largest &lsquo;patch&rsquo; is provided
by an argument from enforced beneficence that rests on explicitly
libertarian premises. (See the entry on
 <a href="../justice-healthcareaccess/">justice and access to health care</a>.)
</p>

<h2><a name="SocGraHea">2. A social gradient in health</a></h2>

<p>

The empirical literature's most significant and powerful
reported finding can actually be replicated with <em>any</em> of the
listed candidate social determinants of health (income, education,
occupational rank, social class): This is the existence, within a
given society, of a <em>social gradient</em> in health. The most
significant evidence on the relation between a socially controllable
factor and health comes from the Whitehall studies, conducted in
England by Michael Marmot and his colleagues (1978). In these studies,
the candidate social determinant of health is occupational rank.</p>

<p>

Between 1967 and 1969, Marmot examined some 18,000 male civil servants
aged between 40 and 69 years old. By placing a flag on their records
at the National Health Service (NHS) Central Registry, Marmot was able
to track the cause and date of death for each subject who later
died. His data are unusually good data. To begin with, they are
generated from data-points on specific individuals. Each datum reports
the relation between the occupational rank of a particular person and
the life-span (and cause of death) of the very same person. By
contrast, almost every other study begins from aggregate data. In
addition, a number of important background factors are held constant
for this study population. Notably, all the subjects in this study are
stably employed, they live in the same region (greater London), and
all have free access to health care provided by the NHS.</p>

<p> Figure 1 presents the Whitehall data after 25 years of follow-up
(van Rossum et al. 2000, 181). It reports age adjusted all-cause
mortality rate ratios by employment grade, for three periods of
follow-up. A mortality rate ratio reports the proportion of deaths in
a given group divided by the proportion of deaths in the reference
group. There are four grades in the British Civil Service employment
hierarchy: administrative (highest), professional/executive, clerical,
and &lsquo;other&rsquo; (lowest). The professional/executive grade has
been used as the reference group, so its mortality rate ratio is 1.0
by definition.</p>

<img width="600" src="fig1.png" alt="Figure 1. Social gradient in total mortality, Whitehall 25 year follow-up" />

<p>

Figure 1. Social gradient in total mortality, Whitehall 25 year
follow-up</p>

<p>

The striking and important feature of these data is that the
relationship between employment grade and mortality exhibits a marked
<em>gradient</em>. It is natural to think that, below some threshold
of deprivation, there will be disproportionate ill-health. Yet, in
this study population, there is no deprivation, not even in the lowest
grade (where everyone is still a government employee with free access
to health care).  Furthermore, and notably, there is no
threshold. Rather, there is a <em>step-wise</em> improvement in health
outcomes as one climbs the employment grade ladder. In addition, these
gradients persist even after the mortality rates have been adjusted
for standard risk factors. For example, coronary heart disease (CHD)
accounted for 43 percent of the deaths in the Whitehall study at 10
years of follow-up (Marmot et al. 1984, 1003). Standard risk factors
for CHD include smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar
levels, and height. Figure 2 presents the Whitehall data on mortality
from CHD after 25 years of follow-up (Marmot 2000, 363). It reports
relative rates of death from CHD by employment grade, with
administrators having a rate of 1.0 by definition.  The left bar in
each pair displays the relative rate adjusted for age alone, while the
right bar adjusts it for all the standard risk factors. Correcting for
standard risk factors does explain some of the gradient in CHD
mortality, but no more than a third. The remaining gradient is still
marked.</p>

<h2><a name="OthSocDetHea">3. Other social determinants of health</a></h2>

<p>

The existence of a social gradient in health certainly suggests that
<em>something</em> in addition to health care exercises a powerful
influence on an individual's health&mdash;something, moreover,
that at least correlates with a social variable.  However, it is not
clear exactly what this something is. To begin with, similar domestic
gradients in individual life expectancy can be found when the social
variable is <em>income</em> (McDonough et al. 1997); when it is
<em>education</em> (Huisman et al. 2005; Crimmins and Saito 2001; Elo
and Preston 1996; Kunst and Mackenbach 1994); and when it is
<em>social class</em> (Wilkinson and Marmot 2003).</p>

<p> By itself, therefore, the surface fact of a social gradient in
health is compatible with quite different accounts of the underlying
causal influences on individual health. Each distinct social variable
might function as a &lsquo;marker&rsquo; for a different underlying
causal factor, different social variables might function instead as
alternative markers for the same underlying causal factor, or there
may be some mixture of both. (It is also possible that some social
variables &mdash; e.g., education [see Cutler et al. 2011] &mdash;
function as a relatively direct causal factor.)</p>

<p> Furthermore, it is not clear how much of the correlation between
health and a given social variable is properly causal in the first
place. In some cases, there is clearly some &lsquo;reverse
causation&rsquo; between health and a social variable, notably from
poor health to lower income (Deaton 2002). In addition, there is
plainly some causation among social variables, notably from education
both to higher income and to higher occupational status. </p>

<p>

The choice of the social variable in terms of which to describe some
social gradient in health can be made on a number of different
grounds. One obvious ground would be to choose the variable(s) that
came closest to conveying the operative causal mechanism(s).  Another
ground would be to choose the variable(s) that have independent moral
significance, such as race and gender. These grounds need not exclude
each other and there may be a case for choosing the same variable on
both grounds. The second ground acquires a special relevance if health
inequalities suffered by individuals who also suffer, for example,
from racial discrimination are more unjust than health inequalities
(of the same magnitude) suffered in the absence of racial
discrimination. If one injustice can compound another, then the choice
of social variable may affect the <em>kind</em> of inequality in
health at issue, and not simply its magnitude.</p>

<p>

When the social variable is <em>income</em>, there is an important
further definitional dispute to consider. Income appears to have a
significant effect on life expectancy, even controlling for education
(Backlund et al. 1999). However, there is an on-going debate about
which definition of &lsquo;income&rsquo; is adequate to capture the
contribution individual income makes to individual life expectancy
(see the sample of articles collected in Kawachi et al. 1999).
According to the <em>absolute income hypothesis</em>, the contribution
income makes to individual life expectancy is entirely a function of
the individual's non-comparative income. By contrast, the
<em>relative income hypothesis</em> holds, roughly, that an
individual's life expectancy is also a function of the
<em>relative</em> level of her income&mdash;that is, its level
compared to others' income in her society&mdash;and not simply
of its non-comparative level (Wilkinson 1996). To make this second
hypothesis precise requires one, among other things, to specify the
reference group to which the individual's income is compared and
also the nature of the comparison (for examples, see Deaton 2003). For
an overview of this debate and the state of evidence, see Sreenivasan
(2009a).</p>

<h2><a name="GroInd">4. Groups or individuals?</a></h2>

<p>

Our discussion thus far has implicitly proceeded on the assumption
that inequalities in health are defined in terms of membership in some
social <em>group</em> or other (one of the &lsquo;eight
Americas,&rsquo; e.g., or some occupational rank in the Whitehall
hierarchy). An &lsquo;inequality&rsquo; in health, so defined, is a
difference between the health status of two groups, with the identity
of the group following from the choice of the social variable with
which health is correlated.  While this is how most of the discussion
in the literature on health inequalities is actually structured, the
definition is controversial. Notably, Christopher Murray and
colleagues (1999) argue in favour of an alternative methodology, in
which &lsquo;health inequality&rsquo; refers to &lsquo;the variation
in health status across individuals in a population&rsquo; (537),
rather than to a difference in health status between social
groups.</p>

<p> Stimulated in large part by their article and the reaction to it,
another lively debate considers the basic conceptual question of how
health inequalities should be defined in the first place (for a nice
overview, see Asada 2013).  Should they be defined across social
groups?  Or across individuals instead? It helps to consider this
question on two separate levels.  Let us call the first one the
&lsquo;fundamental moral level&rsquo; and let us assume that, on this
level, the individual is the basic unit of concern.</p>

<p>

Now it may seem as if this assumption compels us to define
&lsquo;health inequality&rsquo; across individuals as well, i.e. to
reject the conventional definition at the fundamental moral level, but
that is a mistake.  Daniel Hausman's (2007, 2013) position in
the debate illustrates this point well.  Despite affirming that the
individual is the fundamental unit of moral concern, he still opposes
defining inequalities in health across individuals.  Hausman's
central claim is that &lsquo;[individual] health inequalities are not
themselves pro tanto injustices&rsquo; (2013, 95).  His underlying
argument focuses on the fact that health inequalities are only a
<em>subset</em>, as it were, of the inequalities with which justice is
concerned.</p>

<p>

For ease of exposition, let us follow Hausman in assuming, more
specifically, that what is of fundamental concern to justice is
individual <em>well-being</em>.  Hausman's main point can then
be formulated as follows: Even though health is both an important
component and cause of well-being, if two individuals are unequal in
health, it does not follow that they are unequal in well-being.  For
obviously, the same two individuals may also be unequal in some other
component of well-being, and the individual who is less healthy may
not have less well-being overall.  For example, A may be healthier
than B, but B may have more friends or be more accomplished than A (or
both), and the latter inequality may have a greater magnitude than the
former (or a greater importance to well-being), so that the less
healthy B may still be better off overall than A (cf. Hausman 2007,
52).  The health inequality between A and B is therefore fully
consistent with there being no fundamental complaint of justice about
their comparative situation (at least, not on behalf of the less
healthy B). Hence, if permission to infer that an injustice obtains is
built into the classification &lsquo;inequality,&rsquo; as Hausman at
least implicitly supposes, we should not classify any health
difference between A and B (or, more generally, between individuals)
as an inequality.</p>

<p>
				
Of course, even on its own terms, the logic of this argument admits of
an important exception: anytime an inequality in health between
individuals is such that it <em>cannot</em> be counter-balanced by any
complementary inequality in (one or more) other components of
well-being&mdash;for example, because it is too large (Hausman 2007,
54)&mdash;then that inequality in health does permit us to infer that
the less healthy individual also has less well-being overall.  Hausman
calls these special health inequalities &lsquo;incompensable&rsquo;
and he accepts that they are immune to his objection: &lsquo;Data
concerning incompensable health inequalities do permit inferences
concerning inequalities in welfare or standing, and they thus provide
relevant information for egalitarians&rsquo; (Hausman 2013, 98).
Accordingly, he restricts the scope of his official argument, so that
it only concerns <em>compensable</em> health inequalities between
individuals.</p>

<p>

By contrast to (compensable) health inequalities between individuals,
health inequalities between social <em>groups</em> typically do, in
Hausman's view, permit inferences about inequalities in overall
well-being.  Since that is his argument for defining &lsquo;health
inequality&rsquo; across social groups, it actually relies on the
assumption that individual well-being is the fundamental unit of moral
concern.  &lsquo;Information about social group health differences
will thus often be relevant to conclusions about justice, not because
group differences matter and individual differences don't, but
because information about differences in QALYs between well-studied
social groups will often license conclusions about the fundamental
inequalities that egalitarians care about&rsquo; (Hausman 2007,
50).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the conclusion thereby licensed about
inequalities in overall well-being&mdash;either on the basis of
inferences from social group differences in health or from
incompensable differences in health between individuals&mdash;is that
the inequalities are <em>pro tanto</em> unjust (Hausman 2007, 52&ndash;3),
rather than simply unjust, i.e. unjust all things considered.  That is
presumably because inequalities in overall well-being, while
fundamental, are still not the only things relevant to justice.  They,
too, are only a subset of the considerations with which justice is
concerned; and so Hausman wants to leave room for the possibility that
some inequalities in overall well-being are nevertheless just, all
things considered. For example, they may be the result of free
individual choice (Hausman 2007, 47) or they may be a necessary
concomitant of some other outcome even more strongly required by
justice (a possibility emphasised, e.g., by Deaton 2013).  (Hausman
2007 actually uses the expression &lsquo;prima facie&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;pro tanto.&rsquo; Hausman 2013 switches to &lsquo;pro
tanto,&rsquo; which I employ throughout).</p>

<p>
											
There are two related difficulties with Hausman's argument.  The
first may be regarded as terminological.  Hausman's main point
clearly establishes that all we are licensed to infer from an
inequality in health between individuals is that, <em>other things
equal</em>, they are unequal in well-being.  (Since other things may
not be equal, it does not follow that they are unequal in well-being
&lsquo;overall&rsquo; or &lsquo;all things considered.&rsquo;) Yet
that is exactly what &lsquo;pro tanto&rsquo; <em>means</em>.  So a
health inequality between individuals does permit us to infer that
they are pro tanto unequal in well-being.  However, a pro tanto
inequality in well-being is also a pro tanto injustice (certainly on
Hausman's assumptions).  Admittedly, <em>more</em> &lsquo;other
things&rsquo; have to be held equal to qualify a health inequality as
an injustice (than need to be held equal so to qualify an inequality
in well-being).  But that is no reason to deny that it is a pro tanto
injustice.  Hence, Hausman's central claim does not follow from
his main point (worse, its negation does follow).</p>

<p> Terminology aside, it seems clear that Hausman's argument
requires us sharply to privilege certain conditions that need to be
held equal to reach a verdict of injustice (e.g., free individual
choice) over other such conditions (e.g., non-health components of
well-being).  The second and more serious difficulty is that the
required privileging simply appears arbitrary.  Without it, the reason
to withhold the classification &lsquo;inequality&rsquo; from
variations in health status across individuals disappears, as does the
argument for a social group definition of &lsquo;health
inequality.&rsquo;</p>

<p> A different and more tailored conclusion that may be drawn from
Hausman's argument, which we shall see independent reason to
affirm later, is that it is artificial and over-simple to put very
much weight on mono-factor normative principles, such as
&lsquo;equality of health-by-itself.&rsquo; Alternatively: despite
being licensed to conclude that it is pro tanto unjust when two
individuals have unequal health, we would do well to bear firmly in
mind how fragile this sort of pro tanto injustice is. Hausman's
argument highlights the variety and ubiquity of factors that can serve
to remove that injustice, while leaving the health inequality itself
fully in place.</p>

<p>

On the other side of the debate, Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen (2013)
argues that we should define &lsquo;health inequality&rsquo; across
individuals at the fundamental moral level.  His argument consists in
two objections to social group definitions. They are related insofar
as both objections advance a version of the point that any group
definition will be inherently arbitrary. Lippert-Rasmussen's
first objection is the &lsquo;intra-group inequality&rsquo; challenge,
according to which there is no reason to treat health inequalities
between groups as being any more unjust than health inequalities
<em>within</em> groups.  Yet, &lsquo;for any selection of groups such
that [health] inequalities between two groups matter, intragroup
[health] inequalities may exist&rsquo; (57).</p>

<p> Lippert-Rasmussen's second objection is the
&lsquo;group-identification&rsquo; challenge. There are any number of
ways to sub-divide a given population into groups.  Holding the
underlying health facts fixed, different choices of group definition
will correspond to different inequalities in health (of different
magnitudes) inhering in the same population.  Some explanation is
called for, then, of the significance in justice of the particular
character of one's favoured group definition.  What is the
relevance to justice, for example, of the apparently artificial
boundaries demarcating the groups&mdash;&lsquo;America 2,&rsquo; say
(Northland low-income rural whites)&mdash;in the &lsquo;eight
Americas&rsquo; analysis from which our opening illustration of
inequalities in health was drawn?</p>

<p> Now, as we have already observed, one obvious option for
discharging this explanatory burden, which Lippert-Rasmussen also
recognises, is to define the groups so that they &lsquo;echo the major
social causes of health equality&rsquo; (58).  He rejects this
response, but his rejection appears to rest primarily on his denial
that social causation (in contrast to natural causation) has any
privileged relevance to justice. We address this point briefly below,
in section 7 (Complications).</p>

<p>Earlier we said that it was helpful to consider the question of
defining health inequalities on two levels, where the first level is
the fundamental moral level.  The main point behind distinguishing
levels here is simply to clarify that the fundamental moral level is
separate from other levels at which the question can be considered and
also more basic than them. In the first instance, then, it does not
matter much how exactly we describe the second level.  We need only
describe it as &lsquo;not the fundamental moral level.&rsquo; How the
other level(s) should be described more specifically will depend on
one's purposes. For example, Asada (2013) describes a
&lsquo;policy&rsquo; level and Lippert-Rasmussen (2013) describes a
level of &lsquo;principles of regulation.&rsquo; While each of these
levels is plainly distinct from the fundamental moral level, they are
also distinct from each other. In general, the considerations germane
to actual policy makers will be much less theoretical than (at least
some of) those germane to evaluating principles of regulation.
Principles of regulation, for instance, &lsquo;must take into account
potentially unjust refusals to cooperate&rsquo; (Lippert-Rasmussen
2013, 56).  By contrast, in actual policy making, no attention is paid
to &lsquo;potentially unjust&rsquo; refusals to cooperate (even if
some may be paid to predictable failures of cooperation).</p>

<p> At the level of policy-making, Asada (2013, 40-41) reviews two
considerations that favour defining health inequalities across
individuals and one that favours defining them across social
groups. She also proposes a novel approach that attempts to combine
the merits of both.  A definition across individuals is favoured by
the fact that data collected on that basis lends itself easily to
international comparisons, whereas data on health inequalities defined
across groups can only be compared between two countries if both
countries have conceived and operationalised the relevant groups in
the same way (which they often have not).  Furthermore, defining
health inequalities across individuals does not require any balancing
or summary operation in order to yield conclusions about overall
inequalities in health, whereas a definition across groups only yields
conclusions about overall inequalities when combined with data from
other relevant groups (e.g., when health inequalities across income
groups are combined with health inequalities across educational
groups).  On the other hand, a definition across groups is favoured by
the fact that the social variable defining the group (e.g., income or
education) often naturally suggests a target for policy intervention,
whereas a definition across individuals suggests no such target and is
thus &lsquo;one step removed from policy&rsquo; (Asada 2013, 41).</p>

<h2><a name="CauPat">5. Causal pathways</a></h2>

<p>

The strategy of aligning the social groups used to define inequalities
in health with the major social causes of health evidently presupposes
that one knows that those causes are. To determine whether any of the
previously discussed correlations between individual life expectancy
and a social variable is causal, one needs some account of the
<em>causal pathways</em> between candidate social determinants and
specific mortality risk factors. Unfortunately, these pathways are not
well understood (Adler and Newman 2002; Adler and Ostrove 1999; Evans
et al. 1994). While research in this area remains preliminary, it may
be useful to describe some of the possibilities.</p>

<p>

To begin with, researchers distinguish <em>material</em> pathways from
<em>psychosocial</em> ones. Certain conditions of absolute material
deprivation constitute well-recognised risks for ill health and
mortality, including inadequate nutrition, lack of clean water and
sanitation, and poor housing. A very plausible causal pathway runs
from low levels of non-comparative individual income through these
material risk factors to lower individual life expectancy.</p>

<p> However, the cited social gradients in life expectancy were mainly
observed in highly developed societies, where the prevalence of
absolute material deprivation is fairly low. In particular, a
significant social gradient was observed in the Whitehall studies,
where the occupants of even the lowest occupational rank were
nevertheless all stably employed civil servants with free access to
health care. Since entire gradients can emerge in the absence of
material deprivation, many researchers have been moved to postulate
additional pathways&mdash;i.e., psychosocial pathways&mdash;between
health and some aspect of social status (Marmot 2004).</p>

<p>

One of the most prominent specific risk factors envisaged as the
terminus for a psychosocial pathway is (the effects of)
<em>stress</em>. As Eric Brunner and Michael Marmot (1999) explain,
the long-term effects of stress differ importantly from its short-term
effects. In the short-term, an individual's fight-or-flight
response to external stressors is beneficial insofar as it enables him
to cope with threats and challenges. Among other things, this acute
stress response involves the activation of neuroendocrine pathways,
along which adrenaline and cortisol (e.g.) are released into the
bloodstream. These hormones stimulate psychological arousal (e.g.,
vigilance) and mobilise energy, while simultaneously inhibiting
functions irrelevant to immediate survival (e.g., digestion, growth,
and repair). An optimal reactivity pattern is characterised by a sharp
increase in levels of circulating adrenaline (and later, cortisol),
followed by a rapid return to baseline once the challenge has
passed. Sub-optimal patterns are characterised by elevated baseline
levels and slower returns to baseline.</p>

<p> By contrast, the long-term effects of stress&mdash;either from
over frequent provocation of acute stress or from chronic
stress&mdash;can be physiologically harmful. Stress-induced damage is
mediated, among other things, by prolonged elevation of adrenaline and
cortisol levels in the blood. Elevated cortisol can lead to the
accumulation of cholesterol (e.g., by raising glucose levels even
during inactivity); and elevated adrenaline increases the
blood's tendency to clot, which can add to the formation of
arterial plaques and thereby lead to increased risk of heart disease
and stroke.  Other risks that may be increased by stress-induced
damage include risks for cancer, infection, and cognitive decline.</p>

<p> A psychosocial pathway running from stress-induced damage&mdash;or
&lsquo;allostatic load&rsquo; (McEwen 1998)&mdash;has next to be
traced to some social factor, preferably one amenable to policy
manipulation. Two factors that have attracted considerable attention
in this connection are &lsquo;social rank&rsquo; and &lsquo;job
control.&rsquo;</p>

<p>

The most specific evidence on the role of <em>social rank</em> in
producing stress-induced damage comes from studies of non-human
primates (Brunner and Marmot 1999; Evans et al. 1994). In various
primate species, social life is organised in terms of clear and stable
dominance hierarchies. Sapolsky and Mott (1987) found that hierarchies
of free-ranging male baboons exhibit an inverse social gradient both
in cortisol elevations and in adverse cholesterol ratios. Subordinate
baboons have higher baseline levels of cortisol and lower levels of
high density lipoprotein (i.e., &lsquo;good&rsquo;) cholesterol than
dominant baboons, while total cholesterol levels are similar across
the hierarchy. In subordinate baboons, cortisol levels also return
slowly to baseline following a challenge, whereas (a sub-set of)
dominant baboons have optimal stress reactivity patterns (Sapolsky
1993). Furthermore, when the dominance hierarchy is experimentally
disrupted, then <em>all</em> the baboons (including the former
dominants) exhibit the sub-optimal stress reactivity patterns of
subordinates.</p>

<p>

Yet more specific evidence that stress-induced damage is sensitive to
rank (i.e., to relative social status) <em>per se</em> comes from
studies of captive macaque monkeys. In these studies, experimenters
manipulated the dominance hierarchy, forcing individual monkeys to
occupy new ranks, while holding their diet and environment
constant. Shively and Clarkson (1994) fed female macaques a
cholesterol rich diet while manipulating their hierarchy. Over a two
year period, all of the monkeys developed atherosclerosis (coronary
plaques). However, dominant monkeys who became subordinate had a
five-fold excess as compared to those who remained dominant.  (Part of
this excess was due to the stress associated simply with a
<em>change</em> in social rank [as distinct from a demotion], since
subordinate monkeys who became dominant also had more atherosclerosis
[albeit, only twice as much] compared to those who remained
subordinate). Cohen and colleagues (1997) exposed male macaques to an
adenovirus while manipulating their hierarchy. They found an inverse
social gradient in the susceptibility to viral infection, with the
occupants of the lowest social rank&mdash;whoever they might
be&mdash;being at &lsquo;substantially greater risk&rsquo; of
infection. Lower status monkeys also exhibited a greater cortisol
response to the hierarchy manipulations, but this did not account for
their differential susceptibility.</p>

<p>

Evidence on the role of <em>low job control</em> in producing
stress-induced damage comes from the Whitehall II study (Marmot et
al. 1997). &lsquo;Job control&rsquo; refers to an individual's
level of task control in the workplace, operationalised here in terms
of a questionnaire concerning decision authority and skill
discretion. One of the principal diseases for which stress-induced
damage increases the risk is coronary heart disease (CHD). In
Whitehall II, there was an inverse social gradient in age-adjusted CHD
incidence: Compared to their high grade counterparts, intermediate
grade male civil servants were 1.25 times more likely to develop a new
case of CHD in a five year interval, while low grade men were 1.5
times more likely. For women, the odds ratios were 1.12 and
1.47. Marmot and his colleagues also found an inverse social gradient
in low job control. Among men, 8.7 percent of high, 26.6 percent of
intermediate, and 77.8 percent of low grade civil servants reported
low job control; for women, the percentages were 10.1, 34.8, and
75.3. But their key finding was that a substantial part of the
gradient in CHD incidence could be attributed to the differences in
job control. Controlling for low job control reduced the low grade
(e.g.) men's odds ratio for new CHD from 1.5 to 1.18 and the
women's from 1.47 to 1.23. By comparison, known CHD risk factors
only reduced the same ratios from 1.5 to 1.3 and from 1.47 to 1.35,
respectively.</p>

<p>

Finally, of course, plausible causal pathways between stress-induced
damage and these particular social factors will only help to breathe
causality into the correlations with which we began if either social
rank or job control can, in turn, be suitably connected with income,
education, occupational rank, or social class. To date, few such
connections have been established, apart from that between job control
and occupational rank.</p>

<p>

In the present context, the point in consulting the empirical
literature on the underlying determinants of health was to establish
whether (and, ideally, to what extent) particular inequalities in
health are avoidable. For the minimal purposes of making an
<em>evaluation</em> in justice&mdash;that is, of opening the door to
such an evaluation&mdash;the available evidence is arguably adequate:
Given that the distributions of income and of education are more or
less socially controllable, as is the composition of occupational
hierarchies, it is hard not to believe that the significant
inequalities in health that correlate with these factors are at least
somewhat avoidable. Otherwise put, it would be implausible, given the
evidence, to deny that these inequalities in health represent any
injustice at all <em>on the grounds</em> that they are
unavoidable.</p>

<p>

Things may be different, however, for the purposes of <em>designing
policy</em> remedies. As Angus Deaton puts it, &lsquo;policy cannot be
intelligently conducted without an understanding of mechanisms;
correlations are not enough&rsquo; (2002, 15). It is not clear that
our existing understanding of the causal pathways between socially
controllable factors and specific mortality risks is sufficiently
well-developed to underwrite concrete policy proposals. Moreover, even
if it were, it would still be a further step to <em>license
implementation</em> of some such proposal.  Among other things, a
licence of this kind requires an account of the comparative
effectiveness of a proposed reform in relation to salient
alternatives.</p>

<h2><a name="Equ">6. Equality</a></h2>

<p>

On the assumption that a particular inequality in health is avoidable,
what else is required to establish that it is unjust?  Dahlgren and
Whitehead (1991) argue that the inequality must also be
<em>unfair</em>, while Anand and Peter (2000) object that unfairness
entails avoidability and so is not really separate from it.  But
avoidability is cleanly separable (in the other direction) from
unfairness, and that can be an analytic advantage.  For example, it
allows the justice of inevitable inequalities in health to be decided
without having to engage the issue of fairness at all.</p>

<p>

Whatever one decides on that point, appeals to fairness will
themselves have to rest on some basis or other. We can distinguish two
fundamentally different approaches to bringing verdicts of fairness to
bear on a given health inequality.  Let us call them the
<em>free-standing</em> and the <em>derivative</em> approaches to the
justice of health inequalities.</p>

<p>

The simplest example of the free-standing approach applies a general
principle of equality directly to the case of health. (For general
discussion of the grounds of egalitarianism, as well as of the
character of different versions, see the entry on
 <a href="../egalitarianism/">egalitarianism</a>.)  With some
qualifications, the resultant requirement of &lsquo;equality of
health&rsquo; is affirmed, for example, by Culyer and Wagstaff
(1993). This implies that <em>any</em> avoidable inequality in health
is unfair or unjust.</p>

<p>

Others might require only that health be &lsquo;more or less&rsquo;
equal. In some contexts, the bounds of this &lsquo;more or less&rsquo;
(i.e., of how much inequality is permissible) can be safely left to
intuitive judgement. For example, it is plausible to
judge&mdash;purely in relation to magnitude&mdash;that the nearly 8
year difference in life expectancy between English men in social class
V (unskilled manual) and those in social class I (professional)
(Wilkinson and Marmot 2003, 10) exceeds the bounds of permissible
inequality, even though these bounds have not been specified. In the
present context, however, this intuitive approach is unfortunately
confounded by the fact that we do not know <em>how much</em> of that 8
year difference is actually avoidable. From the plausibility of
judging that 8 years exceeds the bounds of &lsquo;more or less equal
health&rsquo; and that &lsquo;at least some&rsquo; of the 8 year
difference is avoidable, one cannot safely infer that the observed
inequality in English male life expectancy between social classes V
and I is unfair.</p>

<p>

On the free-standing approach, the injustice of an unjust health
inequality is the primary injustice, although a verdict of injustice
can also be spread <em>backwards</em> from this primary injustice to
its (socially controllable) causes. For example, the causes of the
avoidable part of the inequality in male life expectancy between
social classes V and I are themselves accounted unjust precisely
because their socially controllable <em>effect</em> is unjust
(according to the strict equality principle), and this verdict holds
even if these causes are otherwise permissible (i.e., permissible
apart from their effects).</p>

<p>

By contrast, on the derivative approach, the injustice of an unjust
health inequality is not the primary injustice. Rather, the primary
injustice is some unjust cause of a health inequality, although a
verdict of injustice can also be spread <em>forwards</em> from this
primary injustice to the health inequality itself. In this way, the
injustice of an unjust health inequality derives from the primary
injustice of its cause(s). Suppose, for example, that part of the
difference in life expectancy between white and African-American men
in the United States is caused by racial discrimination. On the
derivative approach, this part of that inequality in health is unjust
because its <em>cause</em> is unjust, and this verdict holds even if
<em>avoidable</em> inequalities in health are not otherwise unjust
(e.g., even if no valid principle of equality applies directly to
health).</p>

<p>

Of course, it is possible for the two approaches to be combined.  If
some valid principle of equality applies directly to health, and if
some independent injustices function as causes of health inequalities,
then a complete account of justice in relation to health inequalities
will require a combined approach. The scenario in which one injustice
attaches directly to the inequality, while another attaches primarily
to its cause also neatly frames the question of whether one injustice
can compound another. Suppose, for example, that a strict equality
principle applies directly to health. In that case, an avoidable
inequality in life expectancy of 2 years between, say, American group
A and American group B would be unjust in itself, whatever its
cause(s). Now suppose, furthermore, that this 2 year inequality is
entirely caused by racial discrimination against group A, committed by
the longer-lived group B. The issue of compounding amounts to asking
whether the injustice of a 2 year inequality in life expectancy is
worse when its cause is independently unjust (second scenario) than
when its cause is otherwise permissible (first scenario) or, to put it
differently, whether there is more injustice in the second scenario,
above and beyond the original injustice of a 2 year inequality in life
expectancy and the added injustice of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>

In both its strict and weakened versions, the free-standing approach
is naturally understood as pronouncing on the <em>pro tanto</em>
injustice of avoidable inequalities in health. This allows for its
verdicts of injustice to be outweighed by other moral considerations
(Culyer and Wagstaff 1993). Among the various kinds of trade-offs
thereby permitted, cases in which equality of health is traded off
against non-health considerations can be distinguished from cases in
which it is traded off against aggregate health gains.</p>

<p> At least where micro-allocation decisions are concerned, Kamm
(2004, 228&ndash;9) holds that health considerations operate in a
&lsquo;separate sphere,&rsquo; against which non-health considerations
have no weight at all. A separate spheres view disallows trading
equality of health off against non-health considerations, but cannot
disallow trading it off against aggregate health gains (after all,
this latter trade-off operates entirely within the health
sphere). Anand (2004) defends a less extreme version of this view. He
argues that a special weight should be attached to considerations of
health, since health is constitutive of well-being and not merely
instrumental to it.  While Anand explicitly countenances trading
equality of health off against aggregate health gains, he concludes
that we should be less tolerant of such trade-offs in the case of
health than in the case of income.</p>

<h2><a name="Com">7. Complications</a></h2>

<p>

We have been assuming throughout that an inequality in health is
unjust only if it is avoidable.  That was the basis, for example, of
treating the best part of the inequality in life expectancy between
women and men as not unjust.  While this assumption is very intuitive,
and widely held, it is nevertheless controversial in some quarters.
Lippert-Rasmussen (2013), among others, rejects it.  In principle,
this is an open controversy.  For present purposes, however, it is
more convenient not to engage the issue.  To this end, we can
distinguish &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; explicitly from
&lsquo;natural justice,&rsquo; where <em>social</em> injustice is
<em>defined</em> to have avoidability as a necessary condition; and
also frame the open controversy in these terms, as Lippert-Rasmussen
himself does: &lsquo;there is such a thing as natural injustice, and
social injustice is not worse per se than natural injustice&rsquo;
(2013, 59). Without prejudging the controversy, we can then simply
avoid it by stipulating that, everywhere in our discussion,
&lsquo;justice&rsquo; and its cognates are to be understood
specifically as social justice.</p>

<p> At the most basic level, a principle of equality can only be
applied to health if &lsquo;health&rsquo; falls within its scope. If
the principle applies unrestrictedly to &lsquo;goods&rsquo; or
&lsquo;functionings,&rsquo; then there will be no obstacle to applying
it to health. Likewise, if the principle requires equality of
&lsquo;welfare,&rsquo; then arguably there will be no such obstacle
either, since &lsquo;welfare&rsquo; is plausibly interpreted to
include &lsquo;health&rsquo; as a constituent. On the other hand, it
is less clear whether health counts as an equilisandum under a
principle of equality of &lsquo;resources.&rsquo; If it were counted,
health would be equalized as a means to some further goal or
condition, but not as a goal in itself. While health can plausibly be
seen as an important means to various intrinsically valuable goals,
the canonical defense of the equality of resources principle does not
interpret health as a &lsquo;resource&rsquo; in its technical sense
(Dworkin 2000, chh. 1&ndash;2).</p>

<p>

More significantly, the implications a principle of equality has for
health may also depend on how &lsquo;equality&rsquo; itself is
understood. For instance, it can be defined in either relative or
absolute terms. In perhaps more familiar language, egalitarianism can
either be defined as requiring <em>equality</em> spoken strictly or as
requiring <em>priority</em> to the worse off (Parfit 2001).  On the
first interpretation (i.e., the relative one), the demands of
egalitarianism are essentially comparative: equality (e.g., of health)
requires that a given person have the <em>same health as others</em>
in some specified reference group (e.g., those in the same society or
humanity at large). On the second interpretation (i.e., the absolute
one), the demands of egalitarianism are essentially non-comparative: a
&lsquo;priority of health&rsquo; principle requires that a given
person have as much health as possible, as judged by some
non-comparative metric (e.g., absolute years of life expectancy). More
precisely, a priority of health principle holds that the more badly
off a given person is on the non-comparative metric (e.g., the fewer
her years of life expectancy), the greater the moral weight that
attaches to a given increment of improvement in her health (e.g., the
addition of a year to her life expectancy).</p>

<p> In many cases, an equality of health principle and a priority of
health principle have the same practical implications. Most saliently,
if one individual (or group) avoidably has a lower life expectancy
than another, then both principles will condemn the resultant
inequality of health and also sanction efforts to improve the life
expectancy of the worse off person (or group). The two principles
differ most importantly where an avoidable inequality of health can be
eliminated, not by improving the health of the worse off person (or
group), but only by reducing the health of the better off person (or
group). Here a priority of health principle will not recognize any
reason to reduce the health of the better off, whereas an equality of
health principle will recognize a reason to reduce the health of the
better off&mdash;namely, that it eliminates the inequality. This
illustrates the so-called &lsquo;levelling down&rsquo; objection
against principles of equality. Parfit (2001) regards this as a
compelling objection, though Temkin (1993) and Eyal (2013) do not.</p>

<p>

Further complications arise when the distinction between equality and
priority runs across our previous distinction between free-standing
and derivative approaches to applying egalitarianism to the case of
health. To bring the clearest examples into view, let us focus on
<em>income</em> as a social determinant of health and assume that
individual income makes a causal contribution to individual life
expectancy. On the derivative approach, the justice of the
<em>causes</em> of health is the primary locus of assessment. But
whether the health inequalities suffered in consequence of an income
inequality count as injustices may depend on the structure of our
normative principle, since that may affect whether the income
inequality itself (i.e., the cause) counts as unjust in the first
place. Suppose that levelling down with respect to income (i.e.,
reducing the income of the rich without raising that of the poor) were
the only way to eliminate a given income inequality. In that case, the
income inequality would not count as an injustice on a
<em>priority</em> of income principle, and hence neither would the
consequent health inequality. However, both inequalities would still
count as injustices on an equality of income principle.</p>

<p>

On the free-standing approach, the (in)justice of health inequalities
themselves is the primary locus of assessment. Consider the case in
which normatively we affirm a priority of health principle, but
empirically the <em>relative</em> income hypothesis is
correct&mdash;that is, an individual's life expectancy is also a
function of her income as compared to others' income in her
society and not simply of its non-comparative level. Here levelling
down with respect to income will produce an <em>absolute</em> health
gain for the worse off in terms of income. Hence, it will be licensed
by a priority of health principle (especially if the worse off in
terms of income are also worse off in terms of health), since an
absolute health inequality will (avoidably) persist if we omit to
reduce the income of the better off. A similar observation is made by
Brighouse and Swift, as part of their discussion of &lsquo;positional
goods&rsquo; (2006, 480). They regard the case as one in which there
is reason to &lsquo;level down.&rsquo; However, a lot depends here on
definitions (cf. Brighouse and Swift 2006, 477&ndash;78). In the sense
of Parfit's objection, &lsquo;levelling down&rsquo; requires the
elimination of the inequality not to produce <em>any</em> absolute
benefit to anyone. Our case does not involve levelling down in this
sense, as it does produce absolute health benefits for some (via the
relative income hypothesis), even though it does not produce absolute
income benefits for anyone.  Consideration of this last sprinkling of
cases may suggest instead that it is artificial and over-simple to put
very much weight on mono-factor normative principles, such as
&lsquo;equality of income-by-itself&rsquo; or &lsquo;priority of
health-by-itself.&rsquo; This reinforces the main constructive point
that emerged from our discussion of Hausman's (2007, 2013)
argument against defining health inequalities across individuals.</p>

<h2><a name="ChoRes">8. Choice and responsibility</a></h2>

<p> A final complication to consider concerns the accommodation of
personal responsibility. &lsquo;Luck egalitarians&rsquo; have argued
that, in general, we should discount the moral significance of
negative outcomes suffered by an agent (e.g., an inequality of
well-being), at least when they are the clear result of a clear choice
by that same agent&mdash;with the result that these outcomes neither
count as injustices nor are they eligible for social redress (see
Anderson 1999). A symmetrical discounting is recommended for positive
outcomes. Analogous discounts can be invoked by prioritarians as
well&mdash;for example, Arneson (2000) affirms what he calls
&lsquo;responsibility catering prioritarianism.&rsquo;</p>

<p> Luck egalitarianism can be applied to health in particular (see,
e.g., Le Grand 1987 and Segall 2010).  In this case, the fundamental
issue is well illustrated by the example of lung cancer and
smoking. If someone has a treatable case of lung cancer, we might
ordinarily reasonably presume that it would be unjust to deny him
medical care. However, if his cancer is due to a heavy, life-long
smoking habit, the question arises of whether the ordinary presumption
is defeated or diminished in strength. For instance, if there is a
choice to be made (say, because of resource scarcity) between treating
him and treating another lung cancer patient who is in no way
responsible for her lung cancer, does justice require preferring the
second patient? A simple application of luck egalitarianism would hold
that it is just to deny treatment to the smoker, as long as his
&lsquo;decision to smoke&rsquo; qualifies as a &lsquo;clear
choice&rsquo; according to some suitable criteria.</p>

<p>

However, neither Le Grand nor Segall take this position in the final
analysis.  Le Grand (2013) avoids it by appealing to the role of
outcome luck (which mitigates the efficacy even of clear choices) and
to the role of misjudgements (which detract from the clarity of many
actual choices), whereas Segall (2010, ch. 4) avoids it by appealing
to value pluralism. By contrast, Wikler (2004) argues that access to
treatment should <em>not</em> be discounted to accommodate
considerations of personal responsibility in the first place.</p>

<h2><a name="JusHeaForAga">9. <em>Just Health</em>, for and against</a></h2>

<p>

Daniels, Kennedy, and Kawachi (2000) propose to decide when health
inequalities are unjust by appeal to Rawls' (1971) theory of
justice. Their contribution is recapitulated by Daniels (2008, ch. 3)
and, for convenience, we refer to the later treatment. Daniels follows
the <em>derivative</em> approach to evaluating health inequalities. In
the first instance, in other words, his evaluative focus is on the
<em>causes</em> of health inequalities. His central claim is that, by
a happy coincidence, Rawls' principles of justice regulate all
of the principal social determinants of health (2008, 82 and 97).</p>

<p>

To begin with, <em>income</em> is regulated by the difference
principle: inequalities in income are permitted only to the extent
that they work to the greatest benefit of the least well off.
<em>Education</em> is regulated by the principle of fair equality of
opportunity, which requires &lsquo;equitable public education&rsquo;
as well as &lsquo;developmentally appropriate day care and early
childhood interventions&rsquo; (Daniels 2008, 96). (<em>Workplace
organisation</em>, if validated as a determinant of health, would also
be regulated under the fair equality of opportunity principle).
<em>Political participation</em>, which Daniels (2008, 95&ndash;6)
regards as a social determinant of health, is regulated by the
principle of equal basic liberty: among other things, this principle
safeguards the fair value of the right to participate
politically. Finally, reaffirming his earlier work (1985), Daniels
maintains that fair equality of opportunity also requires universal
access to comprehensive <em>health care</em> (broadly construed to
include public health).</p>

<p>

To the extent that these social variables are causal determinants of
health, and to the extent that their distribution in society
<em>fails</em> to conform to the corresponding principle of Rawlsian
justice, the resultant health inequalities will be unjust and unjust
because their causes are unjust. The flip-side of this point is that
the implementation of Rawls' principles will tend&mdash;again,
insofar as the relevant determinants are causal&mdash;to flatten the
social gradient in health (Daniels 2008, 82), i.e., to reduce existing
inequalities in health. Hence the title of the jointly authored paper
(2000): &lsquo;justice is good for our health.&rsquo;</p>

<p>

As Daniels notices, observing Rawlsian justice may flatten the social
gradient in health without eliminating it altogether. For example, the
difference principle may permit certain inequalities of income, which
are nevertheless <em>possible</em> to eliminate. If income is a causal
determinant of health, these permissible income inequalities will
(continue to) generate health inequalities if they are left in
place. (This scenario is actually only coherent if the
<em>relative</em> income hypothesis is the correct account of the
causal mechanism.  For the explanation, see Sreenivasan
2009b). Daniels holds that the persistence of avoidable health
inequalities does not give us reason in justice, independently of the
difference principle, to eliminate their underlying cause. In his
view, justice permits some avoidable inequalities in health:
&lsquo;The residual inequalities that emerge with conformance to
[Rawls'] principles are not a compromise with what justice
ideally requires; they are acceptable as just&rsquo; (2008, 99).</p>

<p>

This position has been criticized by Anand and Peter (2000,
50&ndash;52). To begin with, they argue that there is a tension
between two different uses Daniels makes of Rawls' second
principle of justice. On the one hand, they argue, Daniels treats its
two parts as simply regulating certain specific social determinants of
health&mdash;the fair equality of opportunity principle regulates
education (e.g.), while the difference principle regulates income. On
the other hand, his account of health care treats the fair equality of
opportunity principle as regulating <em>health</em> itself
directly. But the latter employment of fair equality of opportunity,
which Anand and Peter actually prefer (2000, 52), threatens to
contradict Daniels' treatment of residual health
inequalities. If fair equality of opportunity requires (some kind of)
egalitarianism about health, then residual health inequalities that
remain after the difference principle is fully implemented may still
fall within <em>its</em> scope. In that case, Rawlsian justice may
well command their reduction.</p>

<p>

Anand and Peter make a further point, which can be put in terms of our
distinction between free-standing and derivative approaches to
evaluating health inequalities.  Daniels' treatment of health
care employs the logic of the free-standing approach, spreading an
evaluation of health backwards on to one of its causes (health
care). Yet his final conclusion requires that we adhere exclusively to
the logic of the derivative approach. For Daniels claims that residual
health inequalities are just&mdash;not because they fall within the
scope of an explicitly permitted <em>health</em> inequality, as in
&lsquo;more or less&rsquo; equal health, but&mdash;simply because
their causes are otherwise just. However, it is not clear how the
justice of a health inequality's cause could settle the question
of its permissibility unless <em>no</em> valid principle of justice
applies directly to health inequalities. If that is right, then in
addition to eschewing even partial reliance on it himself, Daniels has
to show that no version of the free-standing approach is valid. As
Anand and Peter put it: &lsquo;This view relies on the
premise&mdash;not made explicit by the authors&mdash;that inequalities
in health are unjust if, <em>and only if</em>, they are the result of
unjust social arrangements&rsquo;(2000, 50, emphasis added). But
Daniels offers no argument for the italicised portion of the premiss
his final conclusion requires.</p>
