<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Process Philosophy</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Among the main theoretical alternatives for an ontological
interpretation of the temporal existence of things, contemporary
analytical ontology discusses so-called
&ldquo;four-dimensionalism,&rdquo; &ldquo;eternalism,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;stage theory,&rdquo; which, interestingly, are all
<em>static</em> varieties of Leibniz&rsquo; analysis.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-2">2.</a>  On the first three topics see
 Fortescue 2001, Brown 2005, and Herstein 2005, respectively, on the
 fourth see note 17 below. Process philosophy in the letter or spirit
 of Whitehead has been the most visible strand of contemporary process
 philosophy, carried by a larger group of philosophers (see section
 7. on institutionalization).  Without wanting to diminish the
 significance of Whiteheadian process philosophy, either in itself nor
 for process philosophy, this entry is written with the aim to convey
 that process philosophy is a longstanding and highly diversified
 enterprise that should not be too closely associated with any
 particular school or movement. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-3">3.</a>  After Whitehead&rsquo;s <em>Process and
 Reality</em>, which surely offers a plethora of observations,
 arguments, and analyses in support of all three of these claims,
 proposals for process ontology or metaphysics are rarely presented
 together with an explicit reflection of the conditions of theory
 revision in philosophy. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-4">4.</a>  The history of process philosophy
 contains various vague pointers to the link between cognitive
 habituation and language structure (see e.g., Whitehead 1929:
 49). Nowadays the claim can be properly supported, however, by
 drawing on recent research cognitive linguistics and cognitive
 science, in particular, on recent studies of linguistic relativity;
 moreover, research in linguistic typology, especially on the
 semantics of noun-phrases across languages, can be used to motivate
 the switch to a process ontology on purely methodological grounds,
 see Seibt 2015b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-5">5.</a>  The following reconstruction and
 discussion of Strawson&rsquo;s argument is based on Rescher 1962 and 1996,
 ch. 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-6">6.</a>  A noteworthy forerunner of these
 efforts to clarify the logical features of processes vis-&agrave;-vis
 other categories can be found in Zemach 1970. Aristotle&rsquo;s observation
 that sentences in the progressive govern different inferences
 depending on whether they denote activities (seeing) or developments
 (building a house), respectively, figures central in most ontological
 and linguistic classifications of occurrence types, from Mourelatos
 1978 and Roberts 1979 to the various recent categorizations of
 Aktionsarten in linguistic aspectology. By contrast, Stout (1997,
 2015) and Stewart (1997, 2013) disregard this inferential difference
 and take every sentence with progressive aspect to denote a
 &ldquo;process&rdquo;, contrasting these with &ldquo;events&rdquo;,
 which are denoted by sentences with perfective aspect. Galton and
 Mizoguchi (2009) explore in greater detail the logical differences
 between processes and events (atypically, Galton (2012, 2017) takes
 processes to be abstract patterns of states or upshots). In parallel,
 the Vendler/Kenny classification also launched and reinforced
 research on actions
<em>per se</em>, i.e., on the logic of action discourse for different
types of actions, see e.g. Stout 1996, K&uuml;hl 2008. Based on
Kenny&rsquo;s classification, Fink (1973) argues that only certain types of
occurrences can be the subject of value judgments &mdash; an important
result for the ontology of values. Seibt (2004, 2015b) suggests a
classification of basic occurrence types in terms of inferential
networks, i.e., independently of the features of a particular
language, which is integrated into a more comprehensive approach for a
general classification of processes based on five parameters that
address various structural and compositional aspects. This framework
is developed also with a view to the use of classificatory systems in
computer science (knowledge representation) where
domain&ndash;specific process ontologies are in demand (see e.g.,
Gruninger and Menzel 2003, Aameri 2016). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-7">7.</a>  More recently the
 non-particularist conception has gained more supporters: T. Crowther
 (2012, 2017) defends the conception of processes as stuffs against
 recent particularist views: M. Soteriou (2013) argues that such a
 conception proves advantageous for the task of making sense of the
 unity of human experience (2013); and J.  Hornsby (2012) has
 suggested that human activities are best understood as non-particular
 individuals.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-8">8.</a>  See Steward 2012 and Stout 2017,
 which collects contributions from main protagonists of this recent
 process turn in the ontology of mind.  See also below section 4,
 (iii).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-9">9.</a>  See Rescher 1996 ch. 3, and
 Rubenstein 1997. To be sure, the idea that general or determinable
 entities are concrete has been around since Aristotle; the novel
 twist is to allow for determinable entities to be "subjectless"
 processes (C.D. Broad; see also Sellars (1981)).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-10">10.</a>  For a refurbishment of
 Whitehead&rsquo;s account of persistence see Simons 2008; Seibt (1997,
 2008) deconstructs the dichotomy of endurance (persistent entities
 are identical in time but not extended in time) versus perdurance
 (persistent entities exist in time by having a temporal part that
 exists at that time) and argues that persistence is best understood
 as the literal "recurrence" of activities.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-11">11.</a>  The idea that a process
 philosophy can put (rudimentary forms of) normativity into nature is
 argued in Bickhard 2004 and further developed in Campbell&rsquo;s (2011)
 study on truth as a property of actions (see also below, section 4
 (iii). &mdash; As pointed out above in section 1, in view of recent
 research on embodied cognition, emergence, and non-linear mechanistic
 explanations, it also can be argued that Wilfrid Sellars&rsquo; naturalism
 prefigures a process-based naturalization of normativity;
 importantly, Sellars distinguishes between different kinds or degrees
 of normativity.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-12">12.</a>  For a process view of God as
 sketched in (v) see Rescher 1996, ch. 9.  In connection with this
 issue it might be useful to restate the
<em>caveat</em> from section 2, drawing attention to the fact that
this entry does not detail the contributions of process thought to
 <a href="../process-theism/">process theism</a>.
 While many American process philosophers, especially Whiteheadians,
have been inclined to address general theological questions within the
exposition of a process metaphysics, it should be noted that in the
current international research landscape that this article is trying
to do justice to, theism is not an integral element of a process
philosophy. Many researchers currently working on
process-philosophical themes do not consider the nature of God an
inevitable or even legitimate subject for their research. This need
not be taken as an indication of the increasing atheism among process
philosophers, but merely as an effect of the increasing specialization
of academic research. Guided by the philosophy of
 <a href="../hartshorne/">Charles Hartshorne</a>
 and, more recently, stimulated and promoted by the work of J. L. Cobb
and D.R. Griffin, the area of &ldquo;process theology&rdquo; by now
has become a diversified field of inquiry of its own, combining
philosophy of religion and theology (often Christian theology but more
recently also the theology of religions).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-13">13.</a>  It is not quite clear whether
 Salmon&rsquo;s analysis of causation (as well as Dowe&rsquo;s (1992)
 modification, the "conserved quantity view") is indeed committed to
 processes in the relevant sense that distinguishes them from
 sequences of states; for a process view of causation where this
 commitment is explicit see Ingthorsson 2002.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-14">14.</a>  In Whiteheadian process
 metaphysics such mutual dynamic dependencies are introduced by way of
 informal definitional characterizations&mdash;they are included in
 the description of how prehensions, subjective aim and subjective
 form of an actual entity relate to each other. In a non-Whiteheadian
 process ontology one might need to resort to non-standard mereologies
 to state such dependencies more precisely, see below section 5.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-15">15.</a>  For the use of
 (non-Whiteheadian) process ontology for an interpretation of certain
 concepts of chemistry see Needham 1999, 2003 and Guttinger 2017;
 Stein 2004 has offered a Whiteheadian process metaphysics for
 chemistry.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-16">16.</a>  See Dupr&eacute; and Nicholson
 2017, introduction, as well earlier arguments in Dupr&eacute; (2012,
 ch. 10 and 11, partly co-authored with Maureen O&rsquo;Malley). Surveying
 results from the biology of microbes and metagenomics, Dupr&eacute;
 argues that phenomena of horizontal or lateral gene transfer as well
 as fundamental symbiotic dependencies between microbes and their
 embedding multicellular communities present a severe challenge to the
 traditional notion of the monogenomic biological individual
 (organism) as the focal unit of inheritance and
 selection. &ldquo;Life is in fact a hierarchy of processes (e.g.,
 metabolic, developmental, ecological, evolutionary) and...any
 abstraction of an ontology of fixed entities must do some violence to
 this dynamic reality&rdquo; (p. 188f), which displays more the form
 of a net than single lineages within a &lsquo;tree of
 life.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-17">17.</a>  H&auml;ttich (2004) has adapted
 the Whiteheadian framework for an interpretation of axiomatic quantum
 field theory. For more general expositions of a Whiteheadian approach
 to the interpretation of quantum physics see, e.g., Eppersen 2004 and
 Stapp 2007. The collected volume by Eastman, Epperson, and Griffin
 (2016) offers new perspectives on cross-fertilizations between
 (quantum) physics and speculative philosophy, with focus on the role,
 and the metaphysical interpretation of, of potentiality. Some
 contributors set out a framework of &ldquo;relational realism&rdquo;
 that includes a modal realism; e.g., operating with category theory
 instead of set theory, Michael Epperson (2016) and Elias Zafiris
 (2016) explore new approaches to the decoherence interpretation of
 measurement, treating the difference between actuality and
 potentiality as a feature of reality. Other contributors promote
 &ldquo;process physics&rdquo; outright as an
 &ldquo;information-theoretic modeling of reality&rdquo;) (Klinger
 2016, Cahill 2016). Since the tension between relativity theory and
 quantum physics notoriously has forced physics currently into a mode
 of theory formation that is in the vicinity of speculative thought,
 it is here where philosophical explorations may have particular
 heuristic value for science. Moreover, given that here an space of
 inquiry has opened up that can benefit from fresh ideas, the
 philosophical research community may do well to pay attention to
 proposals from outside established communities (see for example C.
 Carlson&rsquo;s (2004, 2009) suggestion to ground space-time and energy in
 causal networks of basic chunks of becoming (&ldquo;time&rdquo;) or
 attempts to refurbish dialectics in connection with
 information-theoretic modelling (Brenner 2008, 2010).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-18">18.</a>  See Bickhard 2000 and
 Campbell/Bickhard 2011, as well as Wimsatt 1997, where emergence and
 reducibility are defined in terms of types of interactions with a
 physical system.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-19">19.</a>  See especially the work of Mark
Bickhard, a longstanding protagonist of the
&ldquo;interactivist&rdquo; outlook on cognition as cross-disciplinary
intersection for research in cognitive science, psychology, and
philosophy; Bickard&rsquo;s many papers center on embodied cognition
but in effect lay out a comprehensive naturalist process
metaphysics. &ndash; Note, however, that the proponents of
process-based or interaction-based approaches to cognition,
information, and representation do not always agree on the description of
the decisive process architectures. On Bickhard&rsquo;s view low-grade forms
of cognition can be attributed to systems with certain process
architectures independently of the causal evolutionary history of
these systems; in contrast, Terrence Deacon (2010) has argued that the
evolutionary embedding of a certain dynamics is definitionally
constitutive for the occurrence of information. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-20">20.</a>  See Zemach 1970; Roberts 1979;
 Seibt 1990, 1995, 1997; Stout 2015; Galton 2006. Stout (2015) even
 speaks of &ldquo;occurrent continuants.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-21">21.</a>  This explanatory challenge looms
 large if processes are taken to be particular entities, which
 standardly are defined as existing in exactly one location at any
 time at which they exist. But also the &ldquo;recurrence
 account&rdquo; of persistence in General Process Theory, where
 processes are non-particular individuals, still struggles with the
 problem.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-22">22.</a> The editors&rsquo; introduction to
 Dupr&egrave; and Nicholson 2017 offers an instructive overview over
 main figures in the &ldquo;organicist&rdquo; school in philosophy of
 biology during the first decades of the twentieth century and its
 relationship to Whitehead.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

 <a href="index.html#ref-23">23.</a> For an extensive and in-depth
 treatment of questions of complexity see Rescher&rsquo;s 1998; for the
 axiological question addressed here see in particular his 2012.</p>
