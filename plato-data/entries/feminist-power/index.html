<h1>Feminist Perspectives on Power</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Oct 19, 2005; substantive revision Thu Jul 7, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Although any general definition of feminism would no doubt be
controversial, it seems undeniable that much work in feminist theory
is devoted to the tasks of critiquing women&rsquo;s subordination, analyzing
the intersections between sexism and other forms of subordination such
as racism, heterosexism, and class oppression, and envisioning the
possibilities for both individual and collective resistance to such
subordination. Insofar as the concept of power is central to each of
these theoretical tasks, power is clearly a central concept for
feminist theory as well. And yet, curiously, it is one that is not
often explicitly discussed in feminist work (exceptions include Allen
1998, 1999, Caputi 2013, Hartsock 1983 and 1996, Yeatmann 1997, and
Young 1992). This poses a challenge for assessing feminist
perspectives on power, as those perspectives must first be
reconstructed from discussions of other topics. Nevertheless, it is
possible to identify three main ways in which feminists have
conceptualized power: as a resource to be (re)distributed, as
domination, and as empowerment. After a brief discussion of
theoretical debates amongst social and political theorists over how to
define the concept of power, this entry will survey each of these
feminist conceptions.</p>

<h2><a name="DefPow">1. Defining power</a></h2>

<p>
In social and political theory, power is often regarded as an
essentially contested concept (see Lukes 1974 and 2005, and Connolly
1983). Although this claim is itself contested (see Haugaard 2010;
Morriss 2002, 199&ndash;206 and Wartenberg 1990, 12&ndash;17), there
is no doubt that the literature on power is marked by deep,
widespread, and seemingly intractable disagreements over how the term
power should be understood.</p>

<p>
One such disagreement pits those who define power as getting someone
else to do what you want them to do, that is, as an exercise of
power-over, against those who define it as an ability or a capacity to
act, that is, as a power-to do something. The classic formulation of
the former definition is offered by Max Weber, who defines power as
&ldquo;the probability that one actor within a social relationship
will be in a position to carry out his own will despite
resistance&hellip;&rdquo; (1978, 53). Similarly, Robert Dahl offers
what he calls an &ldquo;intuitive idea of power&rdquo; according to
which &ldquo;A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do
something that B would not otherwise do&rdquo; (1957, 202&ndash;03).
Dahl&rsquo;s definition sparked a vigorous debate that continued until the
mid-1970s, but even Dahl&rsquo;s best-known critics seemed to agree with his
basic definition of power as an exercise of power-over (see Bachrach
and Baratz 1962 and Lukes 1974). As Steven Lukes notes, Dahl&rsquo;s
one-dimensional view of power, Bachrach and Baratz&rsquo;s two-dimensional
view, and his own three-dimensional view are all variations of
&ldquo;the same underlying conception of power, according to which A
exercises power over B when A affects B in a manner contrary to B&rsquo;s
interests&rdquo; (1974, 30). Similarly, but from a very different
theoretical background, Michel Foucault&rsquo;s highly influential analysis
presupposes that power is a kind of power-over; and he puts it,
&ldquo;if we speak of the structures or the mechanisms of power, it is
only insofar as we suppose that certain persons exercise power over
others&rdquo; (1983, 217). Notice that there are two salient features
of this definition of power: power is understood in terms of
power-over relations, and it is defined in terms of its actual
exercise.</p>

<p>
Classic articulations of the latter definition of power (as power-to)
are offered by Thomas Hobbes &mdash; power is a person&rsquo;s
&ldquo;present means&hellip;to obtain some future apparent Good&rdquo;
(Hobbes 1985 (1641), 150) &mdash; and Hannah Arendt &mdash; power is
&ldquo;the human ability not just to act but to act in concert&rdquo;
(1970, 44). Arguing in favor of this way of conceptualizing power,
Hanna Pitkin notes that power is related etymologically to the French
word pouvoir and the Latin potere, both of which mean to be able.
&ldquo;That suggests,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;that power is a
something &mdash; anything &mdash; which makes or renders somebody
able to do, capable of doing something. Power is capacity, potential,
ability, or wherewithal&rdquo; (1972, 276). Similarly, Peter Morriss
(2002) and Lukes (2005) define power as a dispositional concept,
meaning, as Lukes puts it, that power &ldquo;is a potentiality, not an
actuality &mdash; indeed a potentiality that may never be
actualized&rdquo; (2005, 69). (This statement amounts to a significant
revision of Lukes&rsquo;s earlier analysis of power, in which he argued
against defining power as power-to on the grounds that such a
definition obscures &ldquo;the conflictual aspect of power &mdash; the
fact that it is exercised over people&rdquo; and thus fails to address
what we care about most when we decide to study power (1974, 31). For
helpful discussion of whether Lukes&rsquo;s recent embrace of the
dispositional conception of power is compatible with his other
theoretical commitments, see Haugaard (2010)). Some of the theorists
who analyze power as power-to leave power-over entirely out of their
analysis. For example, Arendt distinguishes power sharply from
authority, strength, force, and violence, and offers a normative
account in which power is understood as an end in itself (1970). As
J&uuml;rgen Habermas has argued, this has the effect of screening any
and all strategic understandings of power (where power is understood
in the Weberian sense as imposing one&rsquo;s will on another) out of her
analysis (Habermas 1994). (Although Arendt defines power as a
capacity, she also maintains that &ldquo;power springs up between men
when they act together and vanishes the moment they disperse&rdquo;
(1958, 200); hence, it is not clear whether she fully accepts a
dispositional view of power). Others suggest that both aspects of
power are important, but then focus their attention on either
power-over (e.g., Connolly 1993) or power-to (e.g., Morriss 2002).
Still others define power-over as a particular type of capacity,
namely, the capacity to impose one&rsquo;s will on others; on this view,
power-over is a derivative form of power-to (Allen 1999, Lukes 2005).
However, others have argued power-over and power-to refer to
fundamentally different meanings of the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; and
that it is a mistake to try to develop an account of power that
integrates these two concepts (Pitkin 1972, Wartenberg 1990).</p>

<p>
Another way of carving up the philosophical literature on power is to
distinguish between action-theoretical conceptions of power &mdash;
that is, those that define power in terms of either the actions or the
dispositional abilities of particular actors &mdash; and broader
systemic or constitutive conceptions of power &mdash; that is, those
that view power as systematically structuring possibilities for
action, or, more strongly, as constituting actors and the social world
in which they act. On this way of distinguishing various conceptions
of power, Hobbes and Weber are on the same side, since both of them
understand power in primarily instrumentalist, individualist, and
action-theoretical terms (Saar 2010, 10). The systemic conception, by
contrast, views power as &ldquo;the ways in which given social systems
confer differentials of dispositional power on agents, thus
structuring their possibilities for action&rdquo; (Haugaard 2010, 425;
see Clegg 1989). The systemic conception thus highlights the ways in
which broad historical, political, economic, cultural, and social
forces enable some individuals to exercise power over others, or
inculcate certain abilities and dispositions in some actors but not in
others. Saar argues, however, that the systemic conception of power
should be understood not as an alternative to the action-theoretical
conception of power, but rather as a more complex and sophisticated
variant of that model. For, as he says, its &ldquo;basic scenario
remains individualistic at the methodological level: power operates on
individuals as individuals, in the form of a &lsquo;bringing to action&rsquo; or
external determination&rdquo; (Saar 2010, 14).</p>

<p>
The constitutive conception of power, by contrast, focuses on the
fundamentally transindividual and relational ways in which individuals
and the social worlds they inhabit are themselves constituted by power
relations. The roots of this constitutive conception can be traced
back to Spinoza (2002a and 2002b), and also found in the work of more
contemporary theorists such as Arendt and Foucault. Here it is
important to note that Foucault&rsquo;s work on power contains both
action-theoretical and constitutive strands. The former strand is
evident in his claim, cited above, that &ldquo;if we speak of the
structures or the mechanisms of power, it is only insofar as we
suppose that certain persons exercise power over others&rdquo;
(Foucault 1983, 217), whereas the latter strand is evident in his
definition of power as &ldquo;the multiplicity of force relations
immanent in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute
their own organization; as the processes which, through ceaseless
struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses
them;&hellip;thus forming a chain or system&rdquo; (Foucault 1979,
92).</p>

<p>
What accounts for the highly contested nature of the concept of power?
One explanation is that how we conceptualize power is shaped by the
political and theoretical interests that we bring to the study of
power (Lukes 1986, Said 1986). For example, democratic theorists are
interested in different things when they study power than are social
movement theorists or critical race theorists or postcolonial
theorists, and so on. On this view, a specific conceptualization of
power could be more or less useful depending on the specific
disciplinary or theoretical context in which it is deployed, where
usefulness is evaluated in terms of how well it &ldquo;accomplishes
the task the theorists set for themselves&rdquo; (Haugaard 2010, 426).
On this view, if we suppose that feminists who are interested in power
are interested in understanding and critiquing gender-based relations
of domination and subordination as these intersect with other axes of
oppression and thinking about how such relations can be transformed
through individual and collective resistance, then we would conclude
that specific conceptions of power should be evaluated in terms of how
well they enable feminists to fulfill those aims.</p>

<p>
Lukes suggests another, more radical, explanation for the essentially
contested nature of the concept of power: our conceptions of power
are, according to him, themselves shaped by power relations. As he
puts it, &ldquo;how we think about power may serve to reproduce and
reinforce power structures and relations, or alternatively it may
challenge and subvert them. It may contribute to their continued
functioning, or it may unmask their principles of operation, whose
effectiveness is increased by their being hidden from view. To the
extent that this is so, conceptual and methodological questions are
inescapably political and so what &lsquo;power&rsquo; means is
&lsquo;essentially contested&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo; (Lukes 2005, 63).
The thought that conceptions of power are themselves shaped by power
relations is behind the claim, made by many feminists, that the
influential conception of power as power-over is itself a product of
male domination (for further discussion, see section 4 below).</p>

<h2><a name="PowResLibFemApp">2. Power as Resource: Liberal Feminist Approaches</a></h2>

<p>
Those who conceptualize power as a resource understand it as a
positive social good that is currently unequally distributed amongst
women and men. For feminists who understand power in this way, the
goal is to redistribute this resource so that women will have power
equal to men. Implicit in this view is the assumption that power is
&ldquo;a kind of stuff that can be possessed by individuals in greater
or lesser amounts&rdquo; (Young 1990, 31).</p>

<p>
The conception of power as a resource can be found in the work of some
liberal feminists (Mill 1970, Okin 1989). For example, in <em>Justice,
Gender, and the Family</em>, Susan Moller Okin argues that the
contemporary gender-structured family unjustly distributes the
benefits and burdens of familial life amongst husbands and wives. Okin
includes power on her list of benefits, which she calls
&ldquo;critical social goods.&rdquo; As she puts it, &ldquo;when we
look seriously at the distribution between husbands and wives of such
critical social goods as work (paid and unpaid), power, prestige,
self-esteem, opportunities for self-development, and both physical and
economic security, we find socially constructed inequalities between
them, right down the list&rdquo; (Okin, 1989, 136). Here, Okin seems
to presuppose that power is a resource that is unequally and unjustly
distributed between men and women; hence, one of the goals of feminism
would be to redistribute this resource in more equitable ways.</p>

<p>
Although she doesn&rsquo;t discuss Okin&rsquo;s work explicitly, Iris Marion Young
argues against this way of understanding power, which she refers to as
a distributive model of power. First, Young maintains that it is wrong
to think of power as a kind of stuff that can be possessed; on her
view, power is a relation, not a thing that can be distributed or
redistributed. Second, she claims that the distributive model tends to
presuppose a dyadic, atomistic understanding of power; as a result, it
fails to illuminate the broader social, institutional and structural
contexts that shape individual relations of power. According to Young,
this makes the distributive model unhelpful for understanding the
structural features of domination. Third, the distributive model
conceives of power statically, as a pattern of distribution, whereas
Young, following Foucault (1980), claims that power exists only in
action, and thus must be understood dynamically, as existing in
ongoing processes or interactions. Finally, Young argues that the
distributive model of power tends to view domination as the
concentration of power in the hands of a few. According to Young,
although this model might be appropriate for some forms of domination,
it is not appropriate for the forms that domination takes in
contemporary industrial societies such as the United States (Young
1990a, 31&ndash;33). On her view, in contemporary industrial
societies, power is &ldquo;widely dispersed and diffused&rdquo; and
yet it is nonetheless true that &ldquo;social relations are tightly
defined by domination and oppression&rdquo; (Young 1990a,
32&ndash;33).</p>

<h2><a name="PowDom">3. Power as Domination</a></h2>

<p>
Young&rsquo;s critique of the distributive model points toward an
alternative way of conceptualizing power, one that understands power
not as a resource or critical social good, but instead views it as a
relation of domination. Although feminists have often used a variety
of terms to refer to this kind of relation &mdash; including
&lsquo;oppression&rsquo;, &lsquo;patriarchy&rsquo;,
&lsquo;subjection&rsquo;, and so forth &mdash;the common thread in
these analyses is an understanding of power not only as power-over,
but as a specific kind of power-over relation, namely, one that is
unjust or illegitimate. In what follows, I use the term
&lsquo;domination&rsquo; simply to refer to such unjust or oppressive
power-over relations. In the following section, I discuss the specific
ways in which feminists with different political and philosophical
commitments &mdash; influenced by phenomenology, radical feminism,
socialist feminism, intersectional feminism, post-structuralism, and
analytic philosophy &mdash; have conceptualized domination.</p>

<h3><a name="PheFemApp">3.1 Phenomenological Feminist Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
The locus classicus of feminist phenomenological approaches to
theorizing male domination is Simone de Beauvoir&rsquo;s <em>The Second
Sex</em>. Beauvoir&rsquo;s text provides a brilliant analysis of the
situation of women: the social, cultural, historical and economic
conditions that define their existence. Beauvoir&rsquo;s basic diagnosis of
women&rsquo;s situation relies on the distinction between being for-itself
&mdash; self-conscious subjectivity that is capable of freedom and
transcendence &mdash; and being in-itself &mdash; the
un-self-conscious things that are incapable of freedom and mired in
immanence. Beauvoir argues that whereas men have assumed the status of
the transcendent subject, women have been relegated to the status of
the immanent Other. As she puts it in a famous passage from the
Introduction to <em>The Second Sex</em>: &ldquo;She is defined and
differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her;
she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He
is the Subject, he is the Absolute &mdash; she is the Other&rdquo;
(Beauvoir, xxii). This distinction &mdash; between man as Subject and
woman as Other &mdash; is the key to Beauvoir&rsquo;s understanding of
domination or oppression. She writes, &ldquo;every time transcendence
falls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of
existence into the &lsquo;en-soi&rsquo; &mdash; the brutish life of
subjection to given conditions &mdash; and liberty into constraint and
contingence. This downfall represents a moral fault if the subject
consents to it; if it is inflicted upon him, it spells frustration and
oppression. In both cases it is an absolute evil&rdquo; (Beauvoir,
xxxv). Although Beauvoir suggests that women are partly responsible
for submitting to the status of the Other in order to avoid the
anguish of authentic existence (hence, they are in bad faith) (see
Beauvoir xxvii), she maintains that women are oppressed because they
are compelled to assume the status of the Other, doomed to immanence
(xxxv). Women&rsquo;s situation is thus marked by a basic tension between
transcendence and immanence; as self-conscious human beings, they are
capable of transcendence, but they are compelled into immanence by
cultural and social conditions that deny them that transcendence (see
Beauvoir, chapter 21).</p>

<p>
More recently, feminist phenomenologists have engaged critically with
Beauvoir&rsquo;s ground-breaking work, and, in so doing, have extended her
insights into power. For example, Iris Young argues that Beauvoir pays
relatively little attention to the role that female embodiment plays
in women&rsquo;s oppression (Young 1990b,142&ndash;3). Although Beauvoir
does discuss women&rsquo;s bodies in relation to their status as immanent
Other, she tends to focus on women&rsquo;s physiology, and how physiological
features such as menstruation and pregnancy tie women more closely to
nature, thus, to immanence. In her essay, &ldquo;Throwing Like a
Girl,&rdquo; Young draws on Maurice Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s phenomenological
analysis of the lived body to analyze &ldquo;the situatedness of the
woman&rsquo;s actual bodily movement and orientation to its surroundings and
its world&rdquo; (Young 1990b, 143). She notes that girls and women
often fail to use fully the spatial potential of their bodies (for
example, they throw like girls), they try not to take up too much
space, and they tend to approach physical activity tentatively and
uncertainly (Young 1990b, 145&ndash;147). Young argues that feminine
bodily comportment, movement, and spatial orientation exhibit the same
tension between transcendence and immanence that Beauvoir diagnoses in
<em>The Second Sex</em>. &ldquo;At the root of those
modalities,&rdquo; Young writes, &ldquo;is the fact that the woman
lives her body as object as well as subject. The source of this is
that patriarchal society defines woman as object, as a mere body, and
that in sexist society women are in fact frequently regarded by others
as objects and mere bodies&rdquo; (Young 1990b, 155). And yet women
are also subjects, and, thus, cannot think of themselves as mere
bodily objects. As a result, woman &ldquo;cannot be in unity with
herself&rdquo; (Young 1990b, 155). Young explores the tension between
transcendence and immanence and the lack of unity characteristic of
feminine subjectivity in more detail in several other essays that
explore pregnant embodiment, women&rsquo;s experience with their clothes,
and breasted experience (See Young 1990b, chapters 9&ndash;11).</p>

<p>
Much important work in feminist phenomenology follows Young in drawing
inspiration from Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s analyses of embodiment and
intercorporeality (see Heinamaa 2003, Weiss 1999); like Young, these
authors use a Merleau-Pontyian approach to phenomenology to explore
the fundamental modalities of female embodiment or feminine bodily
comportment. Feminists have also mined the work of Edmund Husserl, the
founder of phenomenology, for useful resources for feminist
phenomenology (Al-Saji 2010 and Oksala 2016).</p>

<p>
More generally, Oksala&rsquo;s recent work defends the importance of
feminist phenomenology as a exploration of gendered experience against
poststructuralist critics who find such a project hopelessly
essentialist. While Oksala acknowledges that essentialism is a danger
found in some work in feminist phenomenology &ndash; for example, she is
critical of Sonia Kruks (2001) for &ldquo;considering &lsquo;female experience&rsquo; as
an irreducible given grounded in a female body&rdquo; (Oksala 2016, 72) &ndash;
she also insists that a phenomenological analysis of experience is
crucial for feminism. As she puts it, &ldquo;it is my contention that
feminist theory must &lsquo;retrieve experience&rsquo;, but this cannot mean
returning to a pre discursive female experience grounded in the
commonalities of women&rsquo;s embodiment&rdquo; (40). On her view, experience is
always constructed in such a way that it &ldquo;reflects oppressive
discourses and power relations&rdquo; (43); and yet, experience and thought
or discourse are not co-extensive. This means that there is always a
gap between our personal experience and the linguistic representations
that we employ to make sense of that experience, and it is this gap
that provides the space for contestation and critique. Thus, Oksala
concludes, &ldquo;experiences can contest discourses even if, or precisely
because, they are conceptual through and through&rdquo; (50). On Oksala&rsquo;s
view, experience plays a crucial role in reinforcing and reproducing
oppressive power relations, but radical reflection on our experience
opens up a space for individual and collective resistance to and
transformation of those power relations.</p>

<h3><a name="RadFemApp">3.2 Radical Feminist Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Unlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social resource
that ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist phenomenologists,
who understand domination in terms of a tension between transcendence
and immanence, radical feminists tend to understand power in terms of
dyadic relations of dominance/subordination, often understood on
analogy with the relationship between master and slave.</p>

<p>
For example, in the work of legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon,
domination is closely bound up with her understanding of gender
difference. According to MacKinnon, gender difference is simply the
reified effect of domination. As she puts it, &ldquo;difference is the
velvet glove on the iron fist of domination. The problem is not that
differences are not valued; the problem is that they are defined by
power&rdquo; (MacKinnon 1989, 219). If gender difference is itself a
function of domination, then the implication is that men are powerful
and women are powerless by definition. As MacKinnon puts it,
&ldquo;women/men is a distinction not just of difference, but of power
and powerlessness&hellip;.Power/powerlessness is the sex
difference&rdquo; (MacKinnon 1987, 123). (In this passage, MacKinnon
glosses over the distinction, articulated by many second-wave
feminists, between sex &mdash; the biologically rooted traits that
make one male or female, traits that are often presumed to be natural
and immutable &mdash; and gender &mdash; the socially and culturally
rooted, hence contingent and mutable, traits, characteristics,
dispositions, and practices that make one a woman or a man. This
passage suggests that MacKinnon, like Judith Butler (1990) and other
critics of the sex/gender distinction, thinks that sex difference, no
less than gender difference, is socially constructed and shaped by
relations of power.) If men are powerful and women powerless as such,
then male domination is, on this view, pervasive. Indeed, MacKinnon
claims that it is a basic &ldquo;fact of male supremacy&rdquo; that
&ldquo;no woman escapes the meaning of being a woman within a gendered
social system, and sex inequality is not only pervasive but may be
universal (in the sense of never having not been in some form&rdquo;
(MacKinnon 1989, 104&ndash;05). For MacKinnon, heterosexual
intercourse is the paradigm of male domination; as she puts it,
&ldquo;the social relation between the sexes is organized so that men
may dominate and women must submit and this relation is sexual &mdash;
in fact, is sex&rdquo; (MacKinnon 1987, 3). As a result, she tends to
presuppose a dyadic conception of domination, according to which
individual women are subject to the will of individual men. If male
domination is pervasive and women are powerless by definition, then it
follows that female power is &ldquo;a contradiction in terms, socially
speaking&rdquo; (MacKinnon 1987, 53). The claim that female power is a
contradiction in terms has led many feminists to criticize MacKinnon
on the grounds that she denies women&rsquo;s agency and presents them as
helpless victims (for an exemplary version of this criticism, see
Butler 1997).</p>

<p>
Marilyn Frye likewise offers a radical feminist analysis of power that
seems to presuppose a dyadic model of domination. Frye identifies
several faces of power, one of the most important of which is access.
As Frye puts it, &ldquo;total power is unconditional access; total
powerlessness is being unconditionally accessible. The creation and
manipulation of power is constituted of the manipulation and control
of access&rdquo; (Frye 1983, 103). If access is one of the most
important faces of power, then feminist separatism, insofar as it is a
way of denying access to women&rsquo;s bodies, emotional support, domestic
labor, and so forth, represents a profound challenge to male power.
For this reason, Frye maintains that all feminism that is worth the
name entails some form of separatism. She also suggests that this is
the real reason that men get so upset by acts of separatism: &ldquo;if
you are doing something that is so strictly forbidden by the
patriarchs, you must be doing something right&rdquo; (Frye 1983, 98).
Frye frequently compares male domination to a master/slave
relationship (see, for example, 1983, 103&ndash;105), and she defines
oppression as &ldquo;a system of interrelated barriers and forces
which reduce, immobilize, and mold people who belong to a certain
group, and effect their subordination to another group (individually
to individuals of the other group, and as a group, to that
group)&rdquo; (Frye 1983, 33). In addition to access, Frye discusses
definition as another, related, face of power. Frye claims that
&ldquo;the powerful normally determine what is said and sayable&rdquo;
(105). For example, &ldquo;when the Secretary of Defense calls
something a peace negotiation&hellip;then whatever it is that he
called a peace negotiation is an instance of negotiating peace&rdquo;
(105). Under conditions of subordination, women typically do not have
the power to define the terms of their situation, but by controlling
access, Frye argues, they can begin to assert control over their own
self-definition. Both of these &mdash; controlling access and
definition &mdash; are ways of taking power. Although she does not go
so far as MacKinnon does in claiming that female power is a
contradiction in terms, Frye does claim that &ldquo;if there is one
thing women are queasy about it is actually taking power&rdquo; (Frye
1983, 107).</p>

<p>
A similar dyadic conception of male domination can arguably be found
in Carole Pateman&rsquo;s <em>The Sexual Contract</em> (1988) (although in
other respects Pateman&rsquo;s work might be more accurately described as
socialist-feminist rather than radical-feminist). Like MacKinnon,
Pateman claims that gender difference is constituted by domination; as
she puts it, &ldquo;the patriarchal construction of the difference
between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between
freedom and subjection&rdquo; (Pateman 1988, 207). She also claims
that male domination is pervasive, and she explicitly appeals to a
master/subject model to understand it; as she puts it, &ldquo;in
modern civil society all men are deemed good enough to be women&rsquo;s
masters&rdquo; (Pateman 1988, 219). In Pateman&rsquo;s view, the social
contract that initiates civil society and provides for the legitimate
exercise of political rights is also a sexual contract that
establishes what she calls &ldquo;the law of male sex-right,&rdquo;
securing male sexual access to and dominance over women (1988, 182).
As Nancy Fraser has argued, on Pateman&rsquo;s view, the sexual contract
&ldquo;institutes a series of male/female master/subject dyads&rdquo;
(Fraser 1993, 173). Fraser is highly critical of Pateman&rsquo;s analysis,
which she terms the &ldquo;master/subject model,&rdquo; a model that
presents women&rsquo;s subordination &ldquo;first and foremost as the
condition of being subject to the direct command of an individual
man&rdquo; (1993, 173). The problem with this dyadic account of
women&rsquo;s subordination, according to Fraser, is that &ldquo;gender
inequality is today being transformed by a shift from dyadic relations
of mastery and subjection to more impersonal structural mechanisms
that are lived through more fluid cultural forms&rdquo; (1993, 180).
Fraser suggests that, in order to understand women&rsquo;s subordination in
contemporary Western societies, feminists will have to move beyond the
master/subject model to analyze how women&rsquo;s subordination is secured
through cultural norms, social practices, and other impersonal
structural mechanisms. (For Pateman&rsquo;s response to Fraser&rsquo;s criticism,
see Pateman and Mills (2007, 205&ndash;06)).</p>

<h3><a name="SocFemApp">3.3 Socialist Feminist Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
According to the traditional Marxist account of power, domination is
understood on the model of class exploitation; domination results from
the capitalist appropriation of the surplus value that is produced by
the workers. As many second wave feminist critics of Marx have pointed
out, however, Marx&rsquo;s categories are gender-blind (see, for example,
Firestone 1970, Hartmann 1980, Hartsock 1983, Rubin 1976). Marx
ignores the ways in which class exploitation and gender subordination
are intertwined; because he focuses solely on economic production,
Marx overlooks women&rsquo;s reproductive labor in the home and the
exploitation of this labor in capitalist modes of production. As a
result of this gender-blindness, socialist feminists have argued that
Marx&rsquo;s analysis of class domination must be supplemented with a
radical feminist critique of patriarchy in order to yield a
satisfactory account of women&rsquo;s oppression; the resulting theory is
referred to as dual systems theory (see, for example, Eisenstein 1979,
Hartmann 1980). As Iris Young puts it, &ldquo;dual systems theory says
that women&rsquo;s oppression arises from two distinct and relatively
autonomous systems. The system of male domination, most often called
&lsquo;patriarchy&rsquo;, produces the specific gender oppression of
women; the system of the mode of production and class relations
produces the class oppression and work alienation of most women&rdquo;
(Young 1990b, 21). Although Young agrees with the aim of theorizing
class and gender domination in a single theory, she is critical of
dual systems theory on the grounds that &ldquo;it allows Marxism to
retain in basically unchanged form its theory of economic and social
relations, on to which it merely grafts a theory of gender
relations&rdquo; (Young 1990b, 24). Young calls instead for a more
unified theory, a truly feminist historical materialism that would
offer a critique of society and social relations of power as a
whole.</p>

<p>
In a later essay, Young offers a more systematic analysis of
oppression, an analysis that is grounded in her earlier call for a
comprehensive socialist feminism. Young identifies five faces of
oppression: economic exploitation, socio-economic marginalization,
lack of power or autonomy over one&rsquo;s work, cultural imperialism, and
systematic violence (Young 1992, 183&ndash;193). The first three faces
of oppression in this list expand on the Marxist account of economic
exploitation, and the last two go beyond that account, bringing out
other aspects of oppression that are not well explained in economic
terms. According to Young, being subject to any one of these forms of
power is sufficient to call a group oppressed, but most oppressed
groups in the United States experience more than one of these forms of
power, and some experience all five (Young 1992, 194). She also claims
that this list is comprehensive, both in the sense that &ldquo;covers
all the groups said by new left social movements to be
oppressed&rdquo; and that it &ldquo;covers all the ways they are
oppressed&rdquo; (Young 1992, 181; for critical discussion, see Allen
2008b).</p>

<p>
Nancy Hartsock offers a different vision of feminist historical
materialism in her book <em>Money, Sex, and Power</em>: <em>Toward a
Feminist Historical Materialism</em> (1983). In this book, Hartsock is
concerned with &ldquo;(1) how relations of domination along lines of
gender are constructed and maintained and (2) whether social
understandings of domination itself have been distorted by men&rsquo;s
domination of women&rdquo; (Hartsock 1983, 1). Following Marx&rsquo;s
conception of ideology, Hartsock maintains that the prevailing ideas
and theories of a time period are rooted in the material, economic
relations of that society. This applies, in her view, to theories of
power as well. Thus, she criticizes theories of power in mainstream
political science for presupposing a market model of economic
relations &mdash; a model that understands the economy primarily in
terms of exchange, which is how it appears from the perspective of the
ruling class rather than in terms of production, which is how it
appears from the perspective of the worker. She also argues that power
and domination have consistently been associated with masculinity.
Because power has been understood from the position of the socially
dominant &mdash; the ruling class and men &mdash; the feminist task,
according to Hartsock, is to reconceptualize power from a specifically
feminist standpoint, one that is rooted in women&rsquo;s life experience,
specifically, their role in reproduction. Conceptualizing power from
this standpoint can, according to Hartsock, &ldquo;point beyond
understandings of power as power over others&rdquo; (Hartsock 1983,
12). (We&rsquo;ll come back to this point in section 4).</p>

<h3><a name="IntApp">3.4 Intersectional Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Just as socialist feminists tried to broaden the theoretical framework
for analyzing power so that it might encompass both class exploitation
and women&rsquo;s subordination, intersectional theorists have aimed to
broaden the framework even further. The goal of theories of
intersectionality is to develop a single framework for analyzing power
that encompasses sexism, racism, class oppression, heterosexism, and
other axes of oppression in their complex interconnections. The
project of intersectional feminism grew out of black feminism, which
as scholars have recently noted, has a long tradition of examining the
interconnections between racism and sexism, stretching back to the
writing and activism of 19th century black feminists such as Maria W.
Stewart, Ida. B. Wells, Anna Julia Cooper, and Sojourner Truth (see
Gines 2014). Because these thinkers and activists did not use the term
intersectionality, Gines characterizes their work as
proto-intersectional, which she defines as follows: &ldquo;identifying and
combating racism and sexism -- through activist organizing and
campaigning -- not only as separate categories impacting identity and
oppression, but also as systems of oppression that work together and
mutually reinforce one another, presenting unique problems for black
women who experience both, simultaneously and differently than white
women and/or black men&rdquo; (Gines 2014, 14). Other important antecedents
to contemporary intersectionality theory include the Combahee River
Collective&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;interlocking systems of oppression&rdquo; (CRC
1977), Deborah King&rsquo;s analysis of multiple jeopardy and multiple
consciousness (King 1988), and the work from the 1980s of black
feminists such as Audre Lorde, Angela Davis (1984), and bell hooks
(1981). </p>

<p>
In other words, the concept of intersectionality has a long history
and a complex genealogy (for an account of that genealogy, see Collins
2011). But the contemporary discussion and use of the term
intersectionality was sparked by the work of legal theorist Kimberle
Crenshaw (Crenshaw 1991a and 1991b), specifically, by her critique of
single-axis frameworks for understanding domination in the context of
legal discrimination. A single-axis framework treats race and gender
as mutually exclusive categories of experience. In so doing, such a
framework implicitly privileges the perspective of the most privileged
members of oppressed groups &mdash; sex or class-privileged blacks in
race discrimination cases; race or class-privileged women in sex
discrimination cases. Thus, a single-axis framework distorts the
experiences of black women, who are simultaneously subject to multiple
and intersecting forms of subordination. As Crenshaw explains,
&ldquo;the intersection of racism and sexism factors into Black
women&rsquo;s lives in ways that cannot be captured wholly by looking at the
race or gender dimensions of those experiences separately&rdquo;
(Crenshaw 1991b, 1244).</p>

<p>
In the twenty years since the publication of Crenshaw&rsquo;s essays on
intersectionality, this framework has become extraordinarily
influential in women&rsquo;s, gender, and sexuality studies. Indeed, it has
been called &ldquo;the most important contribution that women&rsquo;s studies, in
conjunction with other fields, has made so far&rdquo; (McCall 2005, 1771).
However, feminist philosophers have noted that this influence has yet
to be felt within the mainstream of the discipline of philosophy,
where &ldquo;intersectionality is largely ignored as a philosophical theme
or framework&rdquo; (Goswami, O&rsquo;Donovan and Yount 2014, 6). Moreover,
intersectionality is not without its feminist critics. </p>

<p>
Some proponents of intersectionality have suggested that the concept
is limited in that it focuses primarily on the action-theoretical
level. A full analysis of the intertwining of racial, gender, and
class-based subordination also requires, on this view, a systemic or
macro-level concept that corresponds to the concept of
intersectionality. Echoing the Combahee River Collective (CRC 1977),
Patricia Hill Collins proposes the term &ldquo;interlocking systems of
oppression&rdquo; to fulfill this role. As she explains, &ldquo;the
notion of interlocking oppressions refers to the macro-level
connections linking systems of oppression such as race, class, and
gender. This is the model describing the social structures that create
social positions.Second, the notion of intersectionality describes
micro-level processes &mdash; namely, how each individual and group
occupies a social position within interlocking structures of
oppression described by the metaphor of intersectionality. Together
they shape oppression&rdquo; (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2002, 82).</p>

<p>
Other proponents of intersectionality have worried that discussions of
intersectionality tend to focus too much on relations and sites of
oppression and subordination, without also taking into account
relations of privilege and dominance. As Jennifer Nash has argued,
this has led to &ldquo;the question of whether <i>all</i> identities are
intersectional or whether only multiply marginalized subjects have an
intersectional identity&rdquo; (Nash 2008, 9). Although some feminist
scholars claim that intersectionality encompasses all subject
positions, not just those that are marginalized or oppressed, Nash
goes on to note that &ldquo;the overwhelming majority of intersectional
scholarship has centred on the particular positions of multiply
marginalized subjects&rdquo; (Nash 2008, 9-10). Nash argues that the
over-emphasis on oppression in theories of intersectionality leads
theorists &ldquo;to ignore the intimate connections between privilege and
oppression,&rdquo; for example, by &ldquo;ignor[ing] the ways in which subjects
might be both victimized by patriarchy and privileged by race&rdquo; (Nash
2008, 12). In response to this concern, philosophers such as Ann Garry
have offered a broader, more inclusive conception of intersectionality
that emphasizes both oppression and privilege (see Garry 2011). </p>

<p>
Rather than supplementing the notion of intersectionality with a
macro-level concept of interlocking systems of oppression or
broadening it to include relations of oppression and privilege, Naomi
Zack argues that feminists should move beyond it. Zack maintains that
intersectionality undermines its own goal of making feminism more
inclusive. It does this, on Zack&rsquo;s view, by dividing women into
smaller and smaller groups, formed by specific intersections of race,
class, gender, sexuality, and so forth. As Zack puts it, &ldquo;as a theory
of women&rsquo;s identity, intersectionality is not inclusive insofar as
members of specific intersections of race and class create <i>only</i>
their own feminisms&rdquo; (Zack 2005, 2). Because it tends toward &ldquo;the
reification of intersections as incommensurable identities,&rdquo; Zack
maintains that &ldquo;intersectionality has not borne impressive political
fruit&rdquo; (Zack 2005, 18). </p>

<p>
From a very different perspective, queer feminists Lynne Huffer and
Jasbir Puar have also criticized intersectionality as a theory of
identity. Unlike Zack, however, their concern is not with the
proliferation of incommensurable identities but rather with the ways
in which the notion of intersectionality remains, as Puar says,
&ldquo;primarily trapped within the logic of identity&rdquo; (Puar 2012, 60). As
Huffer puts the point: &ldquo;the institutionalization of intersectionality
as the <i>only</i> approach to gender and sexuality that takes
difference seriously masks intersectionality&rsquo;s investment in a
subject-making form of power-knowledge that runs the risk of
perpetuating precisely the problems intersectionality had hoped to
alleviate&rdquo; (Huffer 2013, 18). </p>

<p>
Finally, Anna Carastathis has argued that the problem with
intersectionality theory lies in its very success (Carastathis 2013
and 2014). Intersectionality has been, on her view, too easily
appropriated by white-dominated feminist theory, cut off from its
roots in Black and women of color feminism, and incorporated into a
self-congratulatory progressivist narrative according to which
&ldquo;intersectionality is celebrated as a methodological triumph over
&lsquo;previous&rsquo; essentialist and exclusionary approaches to theorizing
identity and power relations&rdquo; (Carastathis 2014, 59; for related
critiques, see Nash 2008 and Puar 2012). Carastathis cites Kimberle
Crenshaw&rsquo;s lament that intersectionality&rsquo;s reach is wide but not very
deep, and suggests that this may be the result of aversive racism --
that is, a desire to assert or establish racial innocence, but without
really coming to terms with their own internalized racism -- on the
part of white feminists (Carastathis, 2014, 68-69). </p>

<p>
In response to these sorts of criticisms of intersectionality, some
scholars have attempted to reformulate the concept either as a family
resemblance concept (Garry 2011) or by highlighting its provisionality
(Carastathis, 2014). Others have argued for an expansion of the
intersectional framework to better account for the experiences of
diasporic subjects (Sheth 2014) or for a rethinking of this framework
in relation to a Deleuzian notion of assemblage (Puar 2007 and 2012).
</p>

<h3><a name="PosFemApp">3.5 Poststructuralist Feminist Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Most of the work on power done by post-structuralist feminists has
been inspired by Foucault. In his middle period works (Foucault 1977,
1978, and 1980), Foucault analyzes modern power as a mobile and
constantly shifting set of force relations that emerge from every
social interaction and thus pervade the social body. As he puts it,
&ldquo;power is everywhere, not because it embraces everything, but
because it comes from everywhere&rdquo; (1978, 93). Foucault endeavors
to offer a &ldquo;micro-physics&rdquo; of modern power (1977, 26), an
analysis that focuses not on the concentration of power in the hands
of the sovereign or the state, but instead on how power flows through
the capillaries of the social body. Foucault criticizes previous
analyses of power (primarily Marxist and Freudian) for assuming that
power is fundamentally repressive, a belief that he terms the
&ldquo;repressive hypothesis&rdquo; (1978, 17&ndash;49). Although
Foucault does not deny that power sometimes functions repressively
(see 1978, 12), he maintains that it is primarily productive; as he
puts it, &ldquo;power produces; it produces reality; it produces
domains of objects and rituals of truth&rdquo; (1977, 194). It also,
according to Foucault, produces subjects. As he puts it, &ldquo;the
individual is not the vis-&agrave;-vis of power; it is, I believe, one
of its prime effects&rdquo; (1980, 98). According to Foucault, modern
power subjects individuals, in both senses of the term; it
simultaneously creates them as subjects by subjecting them to power.
As we will see in a moment, Foucault&rsquo;s account of subjection and his
account of power more generally have been extremely fruitful, but also
quite controversial, for feminists interested in analyzing
domination.</p>

<p>
It should come as no surprise that so many feminists have drawn on
Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of power. Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of power has
arguably been the most influential discussion of the topic over the
last thirty years; even those theorists of power who are highly
critical of Foucault&rsquo;s work acknowledge this influence (Lukes 2005
and, in a somewhat backhanded way, Morriss 2002). Moreover, Foucault&rsquo;s
focus on the local and capillary nature of modern power clearly
resonates with feminist efforts to redefine the scope and bounds of
the political, efforts that are summed up by the slogan &ldquo;the
personal is political.&rdquo; At this point, the feminist work that
has been inspired by Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of power is so extensive and
varied that it defies summarization (see, for example, Allen 1999 and
2008a, Bartky 1990, Bordo 2003, Butler 1990, 1993, 1997, Diamond and
Quinby (eds) 1988, Fraser 1989, Hekman (ed) 1996, Heyes 2007, McLaren
2002, McNay 1992, McWhorter 1999, Sawicki 1990, and Young 1990). I
will concentrate on highlighting a few central issues from this rich
and diverse body of scholarship.</p>

<p>
Several of the most prominent Foucaultian-feminist analyses of power
draw on his account of disciplinary power in order to critically
analyze normative femininity. In <em>Discipline and Punish</em>,
Foucault analyzes the disciplinary practices that were developed in
prisons, schools, and factories in the 18th century &mdash; including
minute regulations of bodily movements, obsessively detailed time
schedules, and surveillance techniques &mdash; and how these practices
shape the bodies of prisoners, students and workers into docile bodies
(1977, 135&ndash;169). In her highly influential essay, Sandra Bartky
criticizes Foucault for failing to notice that disciplinary practices
are gendered and that, through such gendered discipline, women&rsquo;s
bodies are rendered more docile than the bodies of men (1990, 65).
Drawing on and extending Foucault&rsquo;s account of disciplinary power,
Bartky analyzes the disciplinary practices that engender specifically
feminine docile bodies &mdash; including dieting practices,
limitations on gestures and mobility, and bodily ornamentation. She
also expands Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of the Panopticon, Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s
design for the ideal prison, a building whose spatial arrangement was
designed to compel the inmate to surveil himself, thus becoming, as
Foucault famously put it, &ldquo;the principle of his own
subjection&rdquo; (1977, 203). With respect to gendered disciplinary
practices such as dieting, restricting one&rsquo;s movement so as to avoid
taking up too much space, and keeping one&rsquo;s body properly hairless,
attired, ornamented and made up, Bartky observes &ldquo;it is women
themselves who practice this discipline on and against their own
bodies&hellip;.The woman who checks her make-up half a dozen times a
day to see if her foundation has caked or her mascara run, who worries
that the wind or rain may spoil her hairdo, who looks frequently to
see if her stocking have bagged at the ankle, or who, feeling fat,
monitors everything she eats, has become, just as surely as the inmate
in the Panopticon, a self-policing subject, a self committed to
relentless self-surveillance. This self-surveillance is a form of
obedience to patriarchy&rdquo; (1990, 80).</p>

<p>
As Susan Bordo points out, this model of self-surveillance does not
adequately illuminate all forms of female subordination &mdash; all
too often women are actually compelled into submission by means of
physical force, economic coercion, or emotional manipulation.
Nevertheless, Bordo agrees with Bartky that &ldquo;when it comes to
the politics of appearance, such ideas are apt and illuminating&rdquo;
(1993, 27). Bordo explains that, in her own work, Foucault&rsquo;s analysis
of disciplinary power has been &ldquo;extremely helpful both to my
analysis of the contemporary disciplines of diet and exercise and to
my understanding of eating disorders as arising out of and reproducing
normative feminine practices of our culture, practices which train the
female body in docility and obedience to cultural demands while at the
same time being experienced in terms of power and control&rdquo;
(ibid). Bordo also highlights and makes use of Foucault&rsquo;s
understanding of power relations as inherently unstable, as always
accompanied by, even generating, resistance (see Foucault 1983).
&ldquo;So, for example, the woman who goes into a rigorous
weight-training program in order to achieve the currently stylish look
may discover that her new muscles give her the self-confidence that
enables her to assert herself more forcefully at work&rdquo; (1993,
28).</p>

<p>
Whereas Bartky and Bordo focus on Foucault&rsquo;s account of disciplinary
power, Judith Butler draws primarily on his analysis of subjection.
For example, in her early and massively influential book, <em>Gender
Trouble</em> (1990), Butler notes that &ldquo;Foucault points out that
juridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come
to represent. Juridical notions of power appear to regulate political
life in purely negative terms&hellip;..But the subjects regulated by
such structures are, by virtue of being subjected to them, formed,
defined, and reproduced in accordance with the requirements of those
structures&rdquo; (1990, 2). The implication of this for feminists is,
according to Butler, that &ldquo;feminist critique ought also to
understand how the category of &lsquo;women&rsquo;, the subject of
feminism, is produced and restrained by the very structures of power
through which emancipation is sought&rdquo; (1990, 2). This
Foucaultian insight into the nature of subjection &mdash; into the
ways in which becoming a subject means at the same time being
subjected to power relations &mdash; thus forms the basis for Butler&rsquo;s
trenchant critique of the category of women, and for her call for a
subversive performance of the gender norms that govern the production
of gender identity. In <em>Bodies that Matter</em> (1993), Butler
extends this analysis to consider the impact of subjection on the
bodily materiality of the subject. As she puts is, &ldquo;power
operates for Foucault in the constitution of the very materiality of
the subject, in the principle which simultaneously forms and regulates
the &lsquo;subject&rsquo; of subjectivation&rdquo; (1993, 34). Thus,
for Butler, power understood as subjection is implicated in the
process of determining which bodies come to matter, whose lives are
livable and whose deaths grievable. In <em>The Psychic Life of
Power</em> (1997), Butler expands further on the Foucaultian notion of
subjection, bringing it into dialogue with a Freudian account of the
psyche. In the introduction to that text, Butler notes that subjection
is a paradoxical form of power. It has an element of domination and
subordination, to be sure, but, she writes, &ldquo;if, following
Foucault, we understand power as forming the subject as well, as
providing the very condition of its existence and the trajectory of
its desire, then power is not simply what we oppose but also, in a
strong sense, what we depend on for our existence and what we harbor
and preserve in the beings that we are&rdquo; (1997, 2). Although
Butler credits Foucault with recognizing the fundamentally ambivalent
character of subjection, she also argues that he does not offer an
account of the specific mechanisms by which the subjected subject is
formed. For this, Butler maintains, we need an analysis of the psychic
form that power takes, for only such an analysis can illuminate the
passionate attachment to power that is characteristic of
subjection.</p>

<p>
Although many feminists have found Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of power
extremely fruitful and productive, Foucault has also had his share of
feminist critics. In a very influential early assessment, Nancy Fraser
argues that, although Foucault&rsquo;s work offers some interesting
empirical insights into the functioning of modern power, it is
&ldquo;normatively confused&rdquo; (Fraser 1989, 31). In his writings
on power, Foucault seems to eschew normative categories, preferring
instead to describe the way that power functions in local practices
and to argue for the appropriate methodology for studying power. He
even seems to suggest that such normative notions as autonomy,
legitimacy, sovereignty, and so forth, are themselves effects of
modern power (this point has been contested recently in the literature
on Foucault; see Allen 2008a and Oksala 2005). Fraser claims that this
attempt to remain normatively neutral or even critical of normativity
is incompatible with the politically engaged character of Foucault&rsquo;s
writings. Thus, for example, although Foucault claims that power is
always accompanied by resistance, Fraser argues that he cannot explain
why domination ought to be resisted. As she puts it, &ldquo;only with
the introduction of normative notions of some kind could Foucault
begin to answer such questions. Only with the introduction of
normative notions could he begin to tell us what is wrong with the
modern power/knowledge regime and why we ought to oppose it&rdquo;
(1989, 29). Other feminists have criticized the Foucaultian claim that
the subject is an effect of power. According to feminists such as
Linda Mart&iacute;n Alcoff and Seyla Benhabib, such a claim implies a
denial of agency that is incompatible with the demands of feminism as
an emancipatory social movement (Alcoff 1990, Benhabib 1992, and
Benhabib et al. 1995; for a reply to this line of criticism, see Allen
2008a chs. 2 and 3). Finally, Nancy Hartsock (1990 and 1996) calls
into question the usefulness of Foucault&rsquo;s work as an analytical tool.
Hartsock makes two related arguments against Foucault. First, she
argues that his analysis of power is not a theory for women because it
does not examine power from the epistemological point of view of the
subordinated; in her view, Foucault analyzes power from the
perspective of the colonizer, rather than the colonized (1990).
Second, Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of power fails to adequately theorize
structural relations of inequality and domination that undergird
women&rsquo;s subordination; this is related to the first argument because
&ldquo;domination, viewed from above, is more likely to look like
equality&rdquo;(1996, 39; for a response to this critique, see Allen
1996 and 1999).</p>

<p>
Despite these and other trenchant feminist critiques of Foucault (see,
for example, Hekman, ed. 1996 and Ramazanoglu, ed. 1993), his analysis
of power continues to be an extremely useful resource for feminist
conceptions of domination. For recent important feminist work that
draws on Foucault&rsquo;s genealogical method to offer an intersectional
analysis of racism and gender or sexual oppression see Feder (2007)
and McWhorter (2009).</p>

<h3><a name="AnaFemApp">3.6 Analytic Feminist Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Important contribution to the feminist literature on power have come
from a very different methodological perspective than the
post-structuralist/Foucaultian perspective discussed in the previous
section. For example, in her 2006 book, <em>Analyzing Oppression</em>,
Ann Cudd draws on the framework of rational choice theory to analyze
oppression (for related work on rational choice theory and power, see
Dowding 2001 and 2009; for critical discussion, see Allen 2008c).</p>

<p>
Cudd defines oppression in terms of four conditions: 1) the group
condition, which states that individuals are subjected to unjust
treatment because of their membership (or ascribed membership) in
certain social groups (Cudd 2006, 21); 2) the harm condition, which
stipulates that individuals are systematically and unfairly harmed as
a result of such membership (Cudd 2006, 21); 3) the coercion
condition, which specifies that the harms that those individuals
suffer are brought about through unjustified coercion (Cudd 2006, 22);
and 4) the privilege condition, which states that such coercive,
group-based harms count as oppression only when there exist other
social groups who derive a reciprocal privilege or benefit from that
unjust harm (Cudd 2006, 22&ndash;23). Cudd then defines oppression as
&ldquo;an objective social phenomenon&rdquo; characterized by these
four conditions (Cudd 2006, 23).</p>

<p>
As Cudd sees it, the most difficult and interesting question that an
analysis of oppression must confront is the &ldquo;endurance question:
how does oppression endure over time in spite of humans&rsquo; rough natural
equality?&rdquo; (Cudd 2006, 25). Any satisfactory answer to this
question must draw on a combination of empirical, social-scientific
research and normative philosophical theorizing, inasmuch as a theory
of oppression is an explanatory theory of a normative concept (Cudd
2006, 26). (That oppression is a normative &mdash; rather than a
purely descriptive &mdash; concept is evident from the fact that it is
defined as an unjust or unfair set of power relations). Cudd argues
that social-theoretical frameworks such as functionalism,
psychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology are inadequate for
theorizing oppression (Cudd 2006, 39&ndash;45). Structural rational
choice theory, in her view, best meets reasonable criteria of
explanatory adequacy and therefore provides the best
social-theoretical framework for analyzing oppression. By appealing to
a <i> structural </i> theory of rational choice, Cudd&rsquo;s analysis of
oppression avoids relying on assumptions about the psychology of
individual agents. Rather, as Cudd puts it, &ldquo;the structural
theory of rational choice assesses the objective social rewards and
penalties that are consequent on&rdquo; the interactions and social
status of specific group members and &ldquo;uses these assessments to
impute preferences and beliefs to individuals based purely on their
social group memberships&rdquo; (Cudd 2006, 45). But, as a structural
theory of <i>rational choice</i>, the framework assumes &ldquo;that
agents behave rationally in the sense that they choose actions that
maximize their (induced) expected utilities&rdquo; (Cudd 2006, 46). In
other words, structural rational choice theory models human actions as
&ldquo;(basically instrumentally rational) individual choice
constrained within socially structured payoffs&rdquo; (Cudd 2006, 37).
When utilized to analyze oppression, structural rational choice theory
suggests that the key to answering the endurance question lies in the
fact that &ldquo;the oppressed are co-opted through their own
short-run rational choices to reinforce the long-run oppression of
their social group&rdquo; (Cudd 2006, 21&ndash;22).</p>

<p>
Sally Haslanger&rsquo;s work on gender and racial oppression, like Cudd&rsquo;s,
is heavily informed by the tools of analytic philosophy, though
Haslanger also situates her work within the tradition of Critical
Theory (see Haslanger 2012, 22-30). Haslanger distinguishes between
two kinds of cases of oppression: agent oppression, in which &ldquo;a person
or persons (the oppressor(s)) inflicts harm upon another (the
oppressed) wrongfully or unjustly&rdquo; (314) and structural oppression, in
which &ldquo;the oppression is not an individual wrong but a
social/political wrong; that is, it is a problem lying in our
collective arrangements, an injustice in our practices or
institutions&rdquo; (314). Having made this distinction, Haslanger then
argues for a mixed analysis of oppression that does not attempt to
reduce agent oppression to structural oppression or vice versa. The
danger of reducing structural oppression to agent oppression -- what
Haslanger calls the individualistic approach to oppression -- is that
doing so fails to acknowledge that &ldquo;sometimes structures themselves,
not individuals are the problem&rdquo; (320). The danger of reducing agent
oppression to structural oppression -- what Haslanger calls the
institutionalist approach -- is that such an approach &ldquo;fails to
distinguish those who abuse their power to do wrong and those who are
privileged but do not exploit their power&rdquo; (320). Haslanger&rsquo;s mixed
approach, by contrast, is &ldquo;attentive simultaneously [and, we might
add, non-reductively] to both agents and structures&rdquo; (11).</p>

<p>
Haslanger also connects her account of structural domination and
oppression to her analysis of gender. Haslanger offers what she calls
a &ldquo;focal analysis&rdquo; of gender, according to which the core of gender is
&ldquo;the pattern of social relations that constitute the social classes of
men as dominant and women as subordinate&rdquo; (228). Other things -- such
as norms, identities, symbols, etc -- are then gendered in relation to
those social relations. On her analysis, gender categories are defined
in terms of how one is socially positioned with respect to a broad
complex of oppressive relations between groups that are distinguished
from one another by means of sexual difference (see 229-230). As
Haslanger explains, the &ldquo;background idea&rdquo; informing this account of
gender is &ldquo;that women are <i>oppressed</i>, and that they are
oppressed <i>as women</i>&rdquo; (231).</p>

<p>
By claiming that women are oppressed as women, Haslanger reiterates an
earlier claim made by radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon
(see, for example, MacKinnon 1987, 56-57. Indeed, Haslanger&rsquo;s analysis
is heavily indebted to MacKinnon&rsquo;s work (see Haslanger 2012,35-82),
though she does not endorse MacKinnon&rsquo;s strong claims about the link
between objectivity and masculinity, nor does she adopt a dyadic (or,
to use Haslanger&rsquo;s terminology, reductively agent focused)
understanding of oppression. But, like MacKinnon, Haslanger believes
that &ldquo;gender categories are defined relationally -- one is a woman (or
a man) by virtue of one&rsquo;s position in a system of social relations&rdquo;
(58). This means that &ldquo;one&rsquo;s gender is an extrinsic property, and...it
is not necessary that we each have the gender we now have, or that we
have any gender at all&rdquo; (58). Since the social relations in terms of
which gender categories are defined are relations of hierarchical
domination and structural oppression, &ldquo;gender is, by definition,
hierarchical: Those who function socially as men have power over those
who function socially as women&rdquo; (61). As Haslanger admits, referencing
the sex/gender distinction, this does not mean that all males have
power over all females -- but it does mean that females who are not
subordinated by males are not, strictly speaking, women, and vice
versa. Moreover, as Haslanger notes, &ldquo;MacKinnon&rsquo;s account of gender,
like others that define gender hierarchically, has the consequence
that feminism aims to undermine the very distinction it depends upon.
If feminism is successful, there will no longer be a gender
distinction as such&rdquo; because the complex of social relations of
domination and structural oppression that give gender its meaning will
no longer exist (62). While endorsing MacKinnon&rsquo;s radical conclusion
with respect to the currently existing gender categories of &lsquo;man&rsquo; and
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;, Haslanger&rsquo;s own account offers a somewhat more nuanced view
that allows for the future possibility of a kind of gender difference
that would not be predicted on gender dominance: &ldquo;gender can be
fruitfully understood as a higher order genus that includes not only
the hierarchical social positions of man and woman, but potentially
other non-hierarchical social positions defined in part by reference
to reproductive function. I believe gender <i>as we know it</i> takes
hierarchical forms as men and women; but the theoretical move of
treating men and women as only two kinds of gender provides resources
for thinking about other (actual) genders, and the political
possibility of constructing non-hierarchical genders&rdquo; (235)</p>

<h2><a name="PowEmp">4. Power as Empowerment</a></h2>

<p>
Up to this point, much of this entry has focused, as does much of the
feminist literature on this topic, on power understood in terms of an
oppressive or unjust power-over relationship. I have used the term
&lsquo;domination&rsquo; to refer to such relationships, though some of the
theorists discussed above prefer the terms &lsquo;oppression&rsquo; or
&lsquo;subjection&rsquo;, and others refer to this phenomenon simply as &lsquo;power&rsquo;.
However, a significant strand of feminist theorizing of power starts
with the contention that the conception of power as power-over,
domination, or control is implicitly masculinist. In order to avoid
such masculinist connotations, many feminists from a variety of
theoretical backgrounds have argued for a reconceptualization of power
as a capacity or ability, specifically, the capacity to empower or
transform oneself and others. Thus, these feminists have tended to
understood power not as power-over but as power-to. (Wartenberg (1990)
argues that this feminist understanding of power, which he calls
transformative power, is actually a type of power-over, albeit one
that is distinct from domination because it aims at empowering those
over whom it is exercised. However, most of the feminists who embrace
this transformative or empowerment-based conception of power
explicitly define it as an ability or capacity and present it as an
alternative to putatively masculine notions of power-over. Thus, in
what follows, I will follow their usage rather than Wartenberg&rsquo;s.)</p>

<p>
For example, Jean Baker Miller claims that &ldquo;women&rsquo;s examination
of power&hellip;can bring new understanding to the whole concept of
power&rdquo; (Miller 1992, 241). Miller rejects the definition of
power as domination; instead, she defines it as &ldquo;the capacity to
produce a change &mdash; that is, to move anything from point A or
state A to point B or state B&rdquo; (Miller 1992, 241). Miller
suggests that power understood as domination is particularly
masculine; from women&rsquo;s perspective, power is understood differently:
&ldquo;there is enormous validity in women&rsquo;s not wanting to use power
as it is presently conceived and used. Rather, women may want to be
powerful in ways that simultaneously enhance, rather than diminish,
the power of others&rdquo; (Miller 1992, 247&ndash;248).</p>

<p>
Similarly, Virginia Held argues against the masculinist conception of
power as &ldquo;the power to cause others to submit to one&rsquo;s will, the
power that led men to seek hierarchical control and&hellip;contractual
constraints&rdquo; (Held 1993, 136). Held views women&rsquo;s unique
experiences as mothers and caregivers as the basis for new insights
into power; as she puts it, &ldquo;the capacity to give birth and to
nurture and empower could be the basis for new and more humanly
promising conceptions than the ones that now prevail of power,
empowerment, and growth&rdquo; (Held 1993, 137). According to Held,
&ldquo;the power of a mothering person to empower others, to foster
transformative growth, is a different sort of power from that of a
stronger sword or a dominant will&rdquo; (Held 1993, 209). On Held&rsquo;s
view, a feminist analysis of society and politics leads to an
understanding of power as the capacity to transform and empower
oneself and others.</p>

<p>
This conception of power as transformative and empowering is also a
prominent theme in lesbian feminism and ecofeminism. For example,
Sarah Lucia Hoagland is critical of the masculine conception of power
with its focus on &ldquo;state authority, police and armed forces,
control of economic resources, control of technology, and hierarchy
and chain of command&rdquo; (Hoagland 1988, 114). Instead, Hoagland
defines power as &ldquo;power-from-within&rdquo; which she understands
as &ldquo;the power of ability, of choice and engagement. It is
creative; and hence it is an affecting and transforming power but not
a controlling power&rdquo; (Hoagland 1988, 118). Similarly, Starhawk
claims that she is &ldquo;on the side of the power that emerges from
within, that is inherent in us as the power to grow is inherent in the
seed&rdquo; (Starhawk 1987, 8). For both Hoagland and Starhawk,
power-from-within is a positive, life-affirming, and empowering force
that stands in stark contrast to power understood as domination,
control or imposing one&rsquo;s will on another.</p>

<p>
A similar understanding of power can also be found in the work of the
prominent French feminists Luce Irigaray and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
Cixous. Irigaray, for example, urges feminists to question the
definition of power in phallocratic cultures, for if feminists
&ldquo;aim simply for a change in the distribution of power, leaving
intact the power structure itself, then they are resubjecting
themselves, deliberately or not, to a phallocratic order&rdquo;
(Irigaray 1985, 81), that is, to a discursive and cultural order that
privileges the masculine, represented by the phallus. If we wish to
subvert the phallocratic order, according to Irigaray, we will have to
reject &ldquo;a definition of power of the masculine type&rdquo;
(Irigaray 1985, 81). Some feminists interpret Irigaray&rsquo;s work on
sexual difference as suggesting an alternative conception of power as
transformative, a conception that is grounded in a specifically
feminine economy (see Irigaray 1981 and Kuykendall 1983). Similarly,
Cixous claims that &ldquo;les pouvoirs de la femme&rdquo; do not
consist in mastering or exercising power over others, but instead are
a form of &ldquo;power over oneself&rdquo; (Cixous 1977,
483&ndash;84).</p>

<p>
Along similar lines, Nancy Hartsock refers to the understanding of
power &ldquo;as energy and competence rather than dominance&rdquo; as
&ldquo;the feminist theory of power&rdquo; (Hartsock 1983, 224).
Hartsock argues that precursors of this theory can be found in the
work of some women who did not consider themselves to be feminists
&mdash; most notably, Hannah Arendt, whose rejection of the
command-obedience model of power and definition of &lsquo;power&rsquo;
as &ldquo;the human ability not just to act but to act in
concert&rdquo; overlaps significantly with the feminist conception of
power as empowerment (1970, 44). Arendt&rsquo;s definition of
&lsquo;power&rsquo; brings out another aspect of the definition of
&lsquo;power&rsquo; as empowerment because of her focus on community
or collective empowerment (on the relationship between power and
community, see Hartsock 1983, 1996). This aspect of empowerment is
evident in Mary Parker Follett&rsquo;s distinction between power-over and
power-with; for Follett, power-with is a collective ability that is a
function of relationships of reciprocity between members of a group
(Follett 1942). Hartsock finds it significant that the theme of power
as capacity or empowerment has been so prominent in the work of women
who have written about power. In her view, this points in the
direction of a feminist standpoint that &ldquo;should allow us to
understand why the masculine community constructed&hellip;power, as
domination, repression, and death, and why women&rsquo;s accounts of power
differ in specific and systematic ways from those put forward by
men&hellip;.such a standpoint might allow us to put forward an
understanding of power that points in more liberatory
directions&rdquo; (Hartsock 1983, 226).</p>

<p>
More recently, the notion of empowerment has been taken up widely by
advocates of &ldquo;power feminism.&rdquo; A reaction against a perceived
over-emphasis on women&rsquo;s victimization and oppression in feminism of
the 1980s, power feminism emerged in the 1990s in the writings of
feminists such as Camille Paglia, Katie Roiphe, Christina Hoff
Sommers, and Naomi Wolf. Although this movement has had more influence
in mainstream media and culture than in academia -- indeed, in many
ways it can be read as a critique of academic feminism -- it has also
sparked scholarly debate. As Mary Caputi argues in her recent book
<i>Feminism and Power: The Need for Critical Theory</i> (2013), power
feminists reject not only the excessive focus on women&rsquo;s victimization
but also the claim, made by earlier empowerment theorists, that women
are &ldquo;sensitive creatures given more to a caring, interconnected web of
human relationships than to the rugged individualism espoused by men&rdquo;
(Caputi 2013, 4). In contrast, power feminists endorse a more
individualistic, self-assertive, even aggressive conception of
empowerment, one that tends to define empowerment in terms of
individual choice with little concern for the contexts within which
choices are made or the options from which women are able to choose.
Caputi argues that power feminism relies on and mimetically reproduces
a problematically masculinist conception of power, one &ldquo;enthralled by
the display of &lsquo;power over&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;power with&rsquo;...&rdquo; (Kaput 2013,
xv). As she puts it: &ldquo;feminism must query the uncritical endorsement
of an empowerment aligned with a masculinist will to power, and disown
the tough, sassy, self-assured <i>but unthinking</i> &lsquo;feminist&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Caputi 2013, 17). Because of its tendency to mimic an
individualistic, sovereign, and masculinist conception of power over,
power feminism, according to Caputi, &ldquo;does little, if anything, to
rethink our conception of power&rdquo; (Caputi 2013, 89). In order to prompt
such a rethinking, Caputi turns to the resources of the early
Frankfurt School of critical theory and to the work of Jacques
Derrida. </p>

<p>
Serene Khader&rsquo;s <i>Adaptive Preferences and Women&rsquo;s Empowerment</i>
offers another recent rethinking of empowerment in feminist theory.
Focusing on empowerment in the context of international development
practice, Khader develops a deliberative perfectionist account of
adaptive preferences. Rather than defining adaptive preferences in
terms of autonomy deficits, Khader defines them as preferences
&ldquo;inconsistent with basic flourishing...that are formed under
conditions nonconductive to basic flourishing and...that we believe
people might be persuaded to transform upon normative scrutiny of
their preferences and exposure to conditions more conducive to
flourishing&rdquo; (Khader 2011, 42). The perfectionism in her account leads
her to emphasize the distinction between merely adaptive preferences
-- those formed through adaptation to existing social conditions --
and what she calls &ldquo;inappropriately adaptive preferences&rdquo; (IAPs) --
preferences that are adaptive to bad or oppressive social conditions
and that are harmful to those who adopt them (52-53). She also insists
that IAPs are most often selective rather than global self-entitlement
deficits (109), which means that they impact individuals&rsquo; sense of
their own worth or entitlement to certain goods not globally but
rather in particular domains and contexts and in relation to certain
specific individuals or groups. This allows her to acknowledge the
psychological effects of oppression working through the mechanism of
IAPs without denying the possibility of agency on the part of the
oppressed. </p>

<p>
Khader draws on her deliberative perfectionist account of IAPs to
diagnose and move beyond certain controversies over the notion of
empowerment that have emerged in feminist development practice and
theorizing. As the concept of women&rsquo;s empowerment has become central
to international development practice, feminists have raised concerns
about the ideological effects of this shift. While acknowledging that
the language of empowerment in development practice can have
ideological effects, Khader addresses these concerns by providing a
clearer conception of empowerment than the one implicit in the
development literature and emphasizing what she understands as the
normative core of this concept, its relation to human flourishing. She
defines empowerment as the &ldquo;<i>process of overcoming one or many IAPs
through processes that enhance some element of a person&rsquo;s concept of
self-entitlement and increase her capacity to pursue her own
flourishing</i>&rdquo; (Khader 2011, 176). This definition of empowerment
enables her to rethink certain dilemmas of empowerment that have
emerged in development theory and practices. For example, many
development practitioners define empowerment in terms of choice, and
then struggle to make sense of apparently self-subordinating choices.
If choice equals empowerment, then does this mean that the choice to
subordinate or disempower oneself is an instance of empowerment?
Khader&rsquo;s finely grained analysis provides an elegant way out of this
dilemma by emphasizing the conditions under which choices are made and
the tradeoffs among different domains or aspects of flourishing that
these conditions may necessitate. Discussing a case of young women in
Tanzania who chose to undergo clitoridectomy <em>after</em> receiving
education about the practice aimed at empowering them, Khader writes:
&ldquo;Are the young women who choose clitoridectomy disempowered because
they have few options for unambiguously pursuing their flourishing or
are they empowered because they have exercised agential capacities by
making a choice? My analysis of IAP allows us to say both&rdquo; (187). For
Khader, empowerment is a messy, complex, and incremental concept. Her
analysis of empowerment enables us to see that &ldquo;self-subordinating
choices can have selective empowering effects under disempowering
conditions&rdquo; (189). But the normative core of her account, its
deliberative perfectionism, insists that &ldquo;a situation where one cannot
seek one&rsquo;s basic flourishing across multiple domains is a tragic one&rdquo;
(189). </p>

<h2><a name="ConTho">5. Concluding thoughts</a></h2>

<p>
As I claimed in the introduction, and as I hope this entry shows, the
concept of power is central to a wide variety of debates in feminist
philosophy. Indeed, the very centrality of this concept to feminist
theorizing creates difficulties in writing an entry such as this one:
since the concept of power is operative on one way or another in
almost all work in feminist theory, it is extremely difficult to place
limits on the relevant sources. Throughout, I have tried to emphasize
those texts and debates in which the concept of power is a central
theme, even if only an implicit one. I have also tried to prioritize
those authors and texts that have been most influential within
feminist philosophy, as opposed to the wider terrain of feminist
theory or gender studies, though I acknowledge that this distinction
is difficult to maintain and perhaps not always terribly useful.
