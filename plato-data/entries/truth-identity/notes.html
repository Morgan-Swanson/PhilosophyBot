<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">The Identity Theory of Truth</a></h2>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a> Throughout
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses in relevant positions are italicized for
clarity and ease of reading: the italicization has no grammatical
significance, and could be omitted without solecism.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> The inclusion of (8)
in the definition of the identity theory pushes it somewhat in the
direction of linguistic idealism: this emerges clearly from
Hornsby&rsquo;s discussion (at 1997: 9). That, though not a problem
for everyone, would or might be objectionable to some upholders of the
identity theory; so again, for that reason too, it makes sense to keep
the two positions (i.e., (5)/(7) and (8)) definitionally separate from
one another.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> The word
&ldquo;thought&rdquo; is capitalized throughout whenever Frege&rsquo;s
special sense is in question.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> See, e.g., Bradley
1914: 112&ndash;13. For further discussion and references, see
Candlish 1989; 1995; 1999b: 209&ndash;12; Baldwin 1991:
36&ndash;40.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> See Baldwin 1991:
44&ndash;8; Candlish 1999a: 234; 1999b: 206&ndash;9.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> Frege 1918&ndash;19:
74; 1977: 25. See Hornsby 1997: 4&ndash;6.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> Sullivan&rsquo;s
ground for proposing that we regard Tractarian objects as senses is
that, like <em>bona fide</em> Fregean senses, they cannot be grasped
in different ways. But one might feel that that was rather inadequate
as a basis for the proposal: there is surely more to Fregean sense
than just the property of transparency. Russell also attached the
property of transparency to his basic objects, but no one, it would
seem, has suggested that Russellian objects are really senses, and the
suggestion would seem to have little going for it (partly, though not
only, because Russell himself explicitly disavowed the whole idea of
Fregean sense).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> Strictly, this phrase
is a solecism: it should be either &ldquo;truth-donors&rdquo; or
&ldquo;true-makers&rdquo;, as K&uuml;nne points out (2003: 158
n. 200).  But unfortunately the incorrect phrase has acquired
currency, so I shall use it here.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> But this assumption is
not essential, and the ensuing discussion can easily be adapted to
accommodate nominalist qualms about universals.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> A question that
arises here is whether tropes might be able to provide a
&ldquo;thinner&rdquo; alternative to such ontologically
&ldquo;rich&rdquo; entities as the fact <em>that Socrates is
wise</em>: for discussion see Dodd 2008a: 7&ndash;9. The problem that
seems to confront any such strategy is that of making the proposed
alternative a genuine one, i.e., of construing the relevant tropes in
such a way that they do not simply collapse into, or ontologically
depend on, entities of the relatively rich form <em>that Socrates is
wise</em>.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> But in favor of
keeping the label &ldquo;theory&rdquo;, see David 2002: 126.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> If Sullivan (2005)
were right about the <em>Tractatus</em>&mdash;<a
href="index.html#HisBac">&sect;2</a> above&mdash;one might think that
Wittgenstein there propounded something like this position.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> In defense of the
possibility of unified false propositions <em>in re</em>, see Gaskin
2006: 215&ndash;20; 2008: 110&ndash;14.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> Notwithstanding
this point, the sense of one linguistic expression can itself be the
referent of another such expression. What is ruled out is that that
entity might be <em>both</em> the sense <em>and</em> referent of the
<em>same</em> expression. At least, so one might naturally assume: but
to discuss this issue fully would take us into the territory of
Frege&rsquo;s views on <em>oratio obliqua</em> and Dummett&rsquo;s
interpretation thereof.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> Dodd 1995 and 1999;
Suhm, Wagemann, Wessels 2000; Gaskin 2006: 181&ndash;4. Dodd withdraws
the charge against McDowell at 2008b: 82. See also his 2008a:
174&ndash;86, where the charge against Hornsby is not so much
withdrawn as made subject to hedging and nuance. It is actually not
clear that Dodd is right to withdraw the charge against McDowell,
given the latter&rsquo;s insistence that facts are &ldquo;perceptible
&hellip; an aspect of the perceptible world&rdquo; (McDowell 1996: 26;
cf. Dodd 2008a: 182). </p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> McDowell 2000;
2005: 84&ndash;5; Hornsby 1999: 241&ndash;2. It is clear from the
final paragraph of one of Hornsby&rsquo;s footnotes (1997: 4, n. 6)
that she embraces an intensional conception of facts, and so locates
them at the level of sense.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a> This issue has
generated some discussion in the literature. Apart from the pieces
already mentioned (in the last two footnotes), see Engels 2001, 2005;
Fish and Macdonald 2007, 2009.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> One might wish to
identify the world with <em>more</em> than merely the true or
obtaining reference-level propositions/facts, but also with the false
or non-obtaining ones. See Gaskin 2006: ch. 6; 2008: ch. 2. And there
is also the problem (if it is one) of facts that cannot be expressed
in language <a href="index.html#DefPreExp">(&sect;1)</a> to worry
about.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> That seems to me to
be the right point to make against McDowell&rsquo;s location of the
world at the level of sense. Sullivan offers another objection. He
writes of McDowell&rsquo;s appeal to <em>de re</em> sense&mdash;the
point that referents are &ldquo;contained in&rdquo; <em>de re</em>
senses&mdash;that </p>

<blockquote><p> this response is too local to be
effective: the descriptive conception of sense is, after all, not
universally wrong. (2005: 60 n. 6) </p></blockquote>

<p> There is perhaps an awkwardness of terminology hereabouts, for we
talk of <em>de re</em> senses, and we have in mind the way in which
(genuine) proper names and demonstrative expressions present their
referents; but of course concept-expressions present <em>their</em>
referents in an equally direct way.  &ldquo;Red&rdquo; refers, as
directly as may be, and certainly not descriptively, to the property
or (Fregean) concept of redness, &ldquo;not&rdquo; refers directly to
negation, and so on. If we are ready to be realists about redness and
negation, then we should speak of <em>de re</em> senses in these
latter cases too, that is, we should speak of their names as having
<em>de re</em> sense. In fact I suggest that the descriptive
conception of Fregean sense <em>is</em> universally wrong, at least
for semantically simple expressions. That is, no genuine
names&mdash;including names of properties, functions, operations,
etc.&mdash;have a descriptive sense or reference. (Of course some
complex expressions, and in particular <em>descriptions</em>, definite
and indefinite, together with names or other linguistic expressions
that abbreviate or in some other way do duty for descriptions,
<em>do</em> have descriptive senses and references.) But that, if
correct, still does not vindicate McDowell&rsquo;s idea that the world
is a sense-level rather than a reference-level entity.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> See Gaskin 2002
(with references to further relevant literature). The problem and its
solution have been discussed in terms not merely of the distinction
between real and formal identity/distinctness, but also the
distinction between the <em>de re</em> and the <em>de dicto</em>. In
both cases, to make the terminology fit our version of the problem,
one needs to work with an extended conception of what it is to be a
<em>res</em>, one which allows such entities as <em>that Socrates is
wise</em> to count as <em>res</em>.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a> I depart from
Candlish&rsquo;s formulation at 1999b: 203. Candlish&rsquo;s
discussion of the &ldquo;right fact&rdquo; problem at this point
involves him in oscillations between formal- and material-mode
versions of the identity theory, i.e., in oscillations between
treating the &ldquo;<em>p</em>&rdquo; as it figures in these versions
(i) as a placeholder for a proposition (formal mode), and (ii) as a
variable occurring in a name position that can be quantified into
(material mode). Not unnaturally, he diagnoses confusion. But these
difficulties seem to be both avoidable and strictly extraneous to the
core of the &ldquo;right fact&rdquo; problem. That problem can be
raised, and I believe solved, without departing from the formal mode
of expression: this is what I attempt to do here.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a> Beall&rsquo;s
formulation has been tidied up slightly, so as to maintain the formal
mode of expression (see previous note).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> In response to an
objector who presses him with </p>

<blockquote><p> You have shown that
the true proposition <em>that</em> <em>p</em> is identical with
<em>a</em> fact, but <em>which</em> fact is it identical with?
</p></blockquote>

<p> Beall indeed gives what, it is here suggested, is the right answer:
&ldquo;It is identical with the fact <em>that</em> <em>p</em>&rdquo;
(2000: 129). However, since he thinks he has &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo;
Candlish&rsquo;s problem by appeal to the indiscernibility of
identicals, Beall is inclined to regard the question as a spurious one
and the answer as unnecessary. If he has failed to show that the
&ldquo;right fact&rdquo; problem is spurious, the answer is crucial to
solving (not dissolving) the problem.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a> See supplement on
<a href="../facts/slingshot-argument.html">the Slingshot Argument</a>
to the <a href="../facts/">Facts entry</a> for discussion and
references.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> See further Gaskin
2008: ch. 2 esp. &sect;15.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a> Oddly, K&uuml;nne,
who advances this argument against the identity theory, seems to
undermine the argument when he remarks in a footnote that
</p><blockquote><p> We would badly affect the rhythm, rhyme, and
reason in Schiller&rsquo;s <em>Ode to Joy</em> if we were to replace
the final word of &ldquo;All men are brothers&rdquo; by &ldquo;male
siblings&rdquo;. Nevertheless, brothers <em>are</em> male siblings,
and &ldquo;brother&rdquo; even <em>means</em> MALE SIBLING. (2003: 11
n. 25).  </p></blockquote><p> If the non-congruence of
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;male sibling&rdquo; does not derogate
from their synonymy, it is unclear why the non-congruence of
&ldquo;true proposition&rdquo; and &ldquo;fact&rdquo; should derogate
from (in some sense) <em>their</em> synonymy. But note that we do not
need here to settle the question whether &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and
&ldquo;male sibling&rdquo; <em>are</em> actually synonymous, in any
sense. Similarly with &ldquo;true proposition&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fact&rdquo;. One view would be that these expressions are not,
strictly speaking, synonymous, in respect of either sense or
reference, but rather necessarily co-extensive. And that is quite
sufficient for the purposes of the identity claim. (So the case would
be like &ldquo;equilateral triangle&rdquo; and &ldquo;equiangular
triangle&rdquo;, which, plausibly, share neither sense nor
reference&mdash;being composite expressions that do not match in
either sense or reference in all their meaningful parts&mdash;but are,
as wholes, necessarily satisfied by the same objects.) See further
Gaskin 2008: ch. 2.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a> The account has to
be slightly complicated to accommodate a distinction between simple
and complex propositions: it will apply directly only to simple
propositions, and indirectly to complex ones. See Gaskin 2006:
220&ndash;4.</p>
