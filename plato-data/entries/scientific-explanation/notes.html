<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Scientific Explanation</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
  See Cartwright, 2004 for a similar diagnosis and for another survey of
some of the issues described here.
</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> In addition to Hempel,
1965 and Salmon, 1989, see also Cartwright, 1983, Earman, 1986,
pp. 80&ndash;110, and van Fraassen, 1989.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> As an illustration of
this attitude, consider Hempel's discussion of &ldquo;support for
counterfactuals&rdquo; as a criterion for distinguishing laws from
accidental generalizations in his (1965). While Hempel agrees that
support for counterfactuals is, as it were, diagnostic of the
law/accident distinction, he also holds that counterfactuals
&ldquo;present notorious philosophical difficulties&rdquo; (1965, p.
339) and because of this cannot be used to provide any independent
purchase on the distinction between laws and accidentally true
generalizations.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> In addition to the
requirement that laws must be exceptionless generalizations, these
include the requirements that laws not contain terms referring to
particular objects or places and the requirement that laws must
contain only projectable predicates in the sense of Goodman, 1955.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> For a similar assessment,
see Salmon, 1989, p. 15.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> For example, according to
Salmon , 1984 all (why) explanations are causal and causal
explanations require tracing causal processes and their intersections
(See section 4). By contrast, Graham Nerlich, 1979 is in rough
agreement with Salmon about what counts as a causal explanation, but
holds that there is an important non-causal form of explanation which
he calls geometrical explanation&mdash;for example, the explanation of the
trajectories of free particles in gravitational field by reference to
the affine structure of space-time. Salmon would presumably deny that
such appeals to space-time structure are explanatory. Sober, 1983
offers another distinction between causal and non-causal forms of
explanation: he contrasts explanations that trace the actual sequence
of events leading up to some outcome which he thinks of as causal,
with a non-causal form of explanation which he calls <em>equilibrium
explanation</em> in which an outcome is explained by showing that a
very large number of initial states of a system will evolve in such a
way that the system ends up in the outcome state that we wish to
explain, but in which no attempt is made to trace the actual sequence
of events leading up to that outcome.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> This argument rests on
the assumption that once one has specified all of the information that
is relevant to some account, and has not left out any relevant
information, one has explained it. In other words, it is assumed that
it is not possible for all of the information that is relevant to some
\(M\) to be insufficient to explain it. Call this the Nothing
More to Be Said (NMTBS) argument. Many other treatments of explanation
(e.g., Railton, 1978) make a similar assumption. It is far from
self-evident that this assumption is correct. Why isn't it possible
that even given a specification of all nomic and causal information
relevant to some explanandum, this falls short of what is required to
explain it? Why can't there be explananda that are simply
unexplainable? As a limiting possibility, imagine an explanandum event
\(M\), the occurrence of which is governed by no laws, which has
no causes, and the frequency of occurrence of which varies in
unpredictable ways across time and space. If there is nothing more to
be said about \(M\) except that it sometimes occurs
spontaneously, does it follow that this information explains why
\(M\) occurs?  The contrary intuition is that the occurrence of
\(M\) is a paradigm case of something that we are unable to
explain. If this correct, the NMTBS argument does not hold in general
and this raises the question of why we should accept it in the
particular case in which all relevant information specifies only the
probability with which an outcome occurs. In other words, why accept
the claim, common to both the <em>IS</em> and <em>SR</em> models, that
statistical theories explain individual outcomes? This issue is
discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> Some writers hold that
the deterministic interpretation of structural equations is optional;
the error terms that figure in such equations may be interpreted as
representing the net effect of the operation of genuinely
indeterministic processes.  It is also arguable that although
conventional causal modeling techniques assume that the macrosopic
causes of juvenile delinquency are deterministic, this does not rule
out the possibility that there are underlying processes at some
micro-level that are indeterministic. If these claims are correct, it
follows that causal modeling techniques are <em>agnostic</em> about
indeterminism.  However, this is not enough to vindicate the
application of the <em>SR</em> model to the sorts of examples covered
by causal modeling techniques since the <em>SR</em> model
<em>requires</em> indeterminism. Thanks to Elliott Sober for helpful
comments on this issue.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> At the risk of completely
overwhelming readers patience for this topic, let me add that
rejecting Hempel's and Salmon's views about the kinds of cases in
which it is appropriate to talk about statistical explanation of
individual outcomes and the structure of such explanations need not
commit one to the position that we can never explain non-determined
individual outcomes. Instead, what follows is that if such
explanations of non-determined outcomes exist, they will be different
in structure from the <em>IS</em> or <em>SR</em> models.  In my view,
the indeterministic contexts in which it is most natural to think in
terms of the explanation of individual outcomes are those in which
indeterministic <em>causes</em> are operative and such explanations
seem to have a rather different structure from what is captured by
either the <em>IS</em> or <em>SR</em> model. Consider the following
illustration of the operation of an indeterministic cause based on
Dretske and Snyder (1972). A radioactive source is introduced into a
chamber for a fixed time period. If the source decays during this
period, it will trigger a Geiger counter that will in turn release a
poisonous gas, killing a cat. Suppose that in fact the source is
introduced, a decay event occurs, and the cat dies. Here it seems
natural to think of the introduction of the source as both a cause of
and as contributing to the explanation of the cat's death, even though
the connection between these two event is indeterministic. As a foil
to both the <em>IS</em> and <em>SR</em> models, consider the following
(very rough and schematic) proposal (cf. Woodward, 2003): A
sufficient condition for the introduction \(S\) of the source to
explain the death \(D\) of the cat is that the following three
conditions are met. (i) \(S\) and \(D\) occur, (ii) If
\(S\) had not occurred, \(D\) would not have occurred, (iii)
the probability \(p\) of \(D\) if \(S\) were to occur
is greater than zero on at least some other occasions on which
\(S\) occurs, where the conditionals in (ii) and (iii) are
interpreted as non-backtracking counterfactuals. Call this is the
probabilistic causality (<em>PC</em>) model. (The formulation (i)&ndash;(iii) 
is intended to apply only to cases in which there is a
single causal path from \(S\) to \(D\) and no pre-emptive or
potential back-up causes are operative. ) The <em>PC</em> model is
quite different from both the <em>IS</em> and <em>SR</em> models. In
contrast to the <em>IS</em> model and in agreement with the
<em>SR</em> model, according to the <em>PC</em> model, whether the
value of \(p\) is high seems to make no difference to the
goodness of the explanation furnished. Even if the probability of
decay was very low, if the decay occurs and the gas is released, the
introduction of the source will be what caused and explains the death
of the cat. This reproduces our pre-analytic judgment about the
example. But in contrast to the <em>SR</em> model, it does not follow
from the <em>PC</em> model that if \(S\) occurs and \(-D\) 
occurs, then the occurrence of \(S\) explains
\(-D\). This does not follow since the result of substituting
\(-D\) for \(D\) in (ii) is a counterfactual claim that is
false.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> See especially Cartwight,
1979 and Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines, 1993, 2000.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> See, for example,
Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines 1993, 2000, Pearl, 2000, Hausman and
Woodward, 1999.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> An example is provided
in Salmon, 1984 and subsequently discussed in Spirtes, Glymour, and
Scheines, 1993, 2000. A collision \(C\) between a cue ball and
two other billiard balls sends the first into the right hand pocket
\((A)\) and the second into the left hand pocket
\((B)\). \(C\) is a common cause of \(A\) and
\(B\) and \(A\) does not cause \(B\) or
vice-versa. Nonetheless, because of the conservation of linear
momentum, the information that \(A\) occurred provides
information about whether \(B\) occurred, even given the
occurrence of \(C\). In other words, \(A\) is statistically
relevant to \(B\), given \(C\), even though \(A\) does
not cause \(B\). Intuitively, the problem is that the property
\(C\) is too coarse-grained. Since the system is presumably
deterministic at a more fine-grained level of description in which we
specify the exact positions and momenta \(M\) of the balls,
conditioning on \(M\) would render \(A\) independent of
(irrelevant to) \(B\). But if we employ variables like \(C\)
that are insufficiently fine grained, the connection between causation
and statistical relevance assumed in both the Causal Markov condition
and the <em>SR</em> model will fail.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> There is evidence from
developmental psychology (e.g., Leslie and Keeble, 1987) that even
very young infants are sensitive to the difference between changes in
the trajectories of moving balls that involve spatio-temporal contact
between the balls and changes in trajectories that do not involve such
contact. In adults the former changes are much more readily perceived
(or judged) to involve causal interactions than the latter. One may
conjecture that the psychological mechanisms at work in such judgments
also underlie our preference for causal explanations that involve
action by contact. But while spatio-temporal clues are a useful
heuristic for picking out causal interactions in some cases, such as
those involving collisions, they provide little guidance and indeed
may be positively misleading in other cases, as we will see below. So
while a preference for causal explanations that contain no
spatio-temporal gaps may be very psychologically natural, it is
dubious that it provides a useful basis for constructing a general
theory of causal explanation.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> 
Cases of causation by omission are cases in which, to put the matter
intuitively, the non-occurrence of some event causes an outcome, as
when a doctor's failure to provide medical help causes the death of
his patient. In such cases, there is no transfer of energy or momentum
from cause to effect and no natural candidate for a connecting
process. Some writers (e.g. Dowe, 2000) conclude on these grounds that
causation by omission is not real or literal causation, although it
possesses some features that makes it similar to cases of real
causation. If omissions can be causes or figure in causal
explanations, this presents an obvious prima facie problem for causal
process theories like Salmon's. Cases of causation by \(C\) of \(E\) by
double prevention or disconnection are cases in which \(C\) prevents or
interferes with the operation of a second factor \(D\) which if
operative would block the occurrence of \(E\). By removing the preventer
\(D\) of \(E\), \(C\) causes \(E\) to occur. Examples are common in biological
contexts&mdash;see Schaffer, 2000, Woodward, 2002, and for more
general discussion of this phenomenon, see Hall, forthcoming and
Lewis, 2000. Again, if it is accepted that citing a disconnecting
cause provides a (scientific) explanation, this is a difficulty for
causal process theory at least as formulated by Salmon.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> One might well wonder
what the basis for this judgment is. Can't the gas as a whole be
&ldquo;marked&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., by heating it&mdash;and won't the
gas transmit this mark, at least for awhile?</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> The reader is reminded
here of a point made in connection with the hidden structure strategy
in: the lower level explanations that &ldquo;underlie&rdquo; upper
level explanations will not always be &ldquo;ideals&rdquo; in terms of
which the upper level explanations are to be judged.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a> Morrison, 2000
emphasizes the heterogeneity of unification and provides a number of
examples illustrating the point that many sorts of unification seem to
have little to do with explanation. Sober, 1999, forthcoming, argues
that at least in many cases we prefer unified theories over less
unified competitors because the former are better confirmed than the
latter, and not because the former provide better explanations than
the latter. In other words, unification is an epistemological virtue
that is relevant to confirmation, but is not an explanatory
virtue.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> These remarks gloss
over some complex issues.  Some classificatory schemes use causal or
etiological information as a basis for constructing
classifications. It may be argued that such classificatory schemes are
not merely descriptive but rather explanatory in virtue of
&ldquo;invoking&rdquo; or &ldquo;appealing to&rdquo; causal
information.  It seems clear, however, that there are other
classificatory schemes that are not guided by causal information but
nonetheless achieve information compression.  Such classifications do
not provide causal explanations.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> Sober, 1999 argues for
the stronger but related thesis that there is &ldquo;no objective
reason &rdquo; (p.551) to prefer unified over disunified 
explanations&mdash;which we prefer will depend on our explanatory interests. 
He also notes that explanations that cite a great deal of micro-detail
and which are regarded by philosophers like Kitcher as &ldquo;less
unified &rdquo; than explanations that abstract from such detail (and
hence can apply to systems with different microstructures) need not be
regarded as competitors&mdash;that is, we don't need to choose
between them. A glance at any molecular biology textbook will show
that Sober is correct in contending that scientists do not always
prefer explanations that abtract away from micro-detail and that we
should reject any theory of explanation that automatically requires
such abstraction. It is of course a further question whether
abstracting explanations should be regarded as &ldquo;more
unified&rdquo; than explanations that provide micro-detail. In fact,
the latter are typically more integrated with fundamental theories in
physics and chemistry and in this respect arguably more unified.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> A parallel problem
applies to the suggestion that all explanation has a <em>DN</em>
structure, unless some version of the hidden structure strategy can be
made to work.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
Recall in particular that
Hempel responds to putative counterexamples that attempt to show that
the <em>DN</em> model fails to capture the directional features of explanation
by claiming that these features are to be understood in terms of
&ldquo;pragmatics&rdquo;, rather than in terms of features a traditional, non-pragmatic 
theory might capture. This response has generally struck
critics as ad hoc. Somewhat ironically, as discussed below, van
Fraasen's diagnosis of the source of explanatory asymmetries is
the same as Hempel's, despite the fact that his account is
fundamentally opposed to Hempel's in many respects. Looked at one
way, van Fraassen simply generalizes Hempel's treatment of
explanatory asymmetries, relegating all of explanation to the realm of
pragmatics.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
I have written
&ldquo;often&rdquo; here because of the following complication: 
Defenders of pragmatic approaches sometimes write as though they are
engaged in a different project from the traditional one, in the sense
that their aim is to characterize a notion of explanation according to
which, e.g., the same body of information might be explanatory for one
audience and not another, and the goal is to specify what all or most uses
of the word &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; have in common  &mdash;i.e., a notion of explanation which is just not the target of
traditional accounts. Thinking of pragmatic accounts in this way,
one might regard them as complimentary to and not in any way in
conflict with traditional projects. Thus there is no reason
in principle for defenders of traditional accounts to object to such  
projects, although traditionalists may be skeptical that they are likely
to produce anything interesting. However, because defenders
of pragmatic accounts have usually wished to use those accounts to
criticize traditional accounts, this suggests that they do not conceive
of what they are doing in only the conciliatory way just
described. This is one of several points in which greater clarity
about goals on the part of both traditionalists and their pragmatic
critics would be salutary.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> 
I am not aware of any
systematic historical exploration of the origins of this particular use
of &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; in connection with accounts of
explanation. However, one conjecture (and it is only a conjecture) is
that it derives, at least in significant part, from linguistics and, in
particular, from the contrast between, on the one hand, syntax
and semantics, (often thought to be &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and
appropriate objects of general, systematic study) and
&ldquo;pragmatics&rdquo; understood as having to do with the use of
language by particular speakers directed toward particular
audiences in particular contexts to achieve particular ends. This
notion of &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; does suggest a connection with what
is idiosyncratic to the psychology of particular language users and
contexts and contrasts with projects that are regarded as providing a
&ldquo;syntax&rdquo; or &ldquo;semantics&rdquo; of
explanation. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
The relevant notion of
stability is the notion discussed in Woodward (2006)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> 
This example also
reminds us that attempts to provide traditional characterizations of
features of explanatory (or at least causal) relationships are by no
means confined to philosophers&mdash;attempts to do this can also be
found in machine learning, as in Janzing et al., 2012, and in normative
theories of causal judgment proposed by psychologists, as in Lombrozo
(2010) and Cheng (2000).</p>

In his very lucid
discussion of pragmatic theories of explanation, Salmon
(1989) stresses the failure of both van Fraassen or Achinstein's
accounts to provide a characterization of an objective 
explanatory relevance relation. While Salmon is correct about this, his
remarks do not fully engage with van Fraassen's and
Achinstein's views that there is no such characterization to be
had.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a> 
A closely related point is that a characterization that
&ldquo;relativizes&rdquo; some feature of an explanation to a context
sometimes can, so to speak, be &ldquo;de-relativized&rdquo; by making
it explicit how the feature in question depends on context&mdash;in
other words, the apparent contextuality may be just a reflection of
the fact that some relevant feature has not been made explicit. For
example, an explanandum for which the contrast class is left implicit
may seem to support a context-relative picture of explanation (for
example, that different explanations of why the conductor is bent will
be appropriate depending on context) but at least sometimes this
appearance may be removed by making the intended contrast class
explicit. It might be argued that once it is made explicit that what
is of interest is why this conductor is bent while others are
straight, it is an &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
matter whether some candidate explanans accounts for this
contrast. For this reason, it seems that we should regard a
thorough-going pragmatic theory as one that (like Achinstein's and
presumably van Fraassen's) claims that explanations have a contextual
element that can't be removed (in a way that satisfies objectivist
constraints) by making the context explicit.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a> Whether one accepts
this assessment will depend in part on whether one thinks that there
are non-causal forms of why-explanation (in the broad and vague sense
of why-explanation gestured at in Section 1). If there are, then a
more adequate theory of causation will take us only part of the way
toward a more satisfactory theory of explanation.</p>

This asymmetry is closely connected to the fact that the shadow length
is upshot of several different factors that are independently
variable; the height of the pole, the orientation of the pole and the
angular distance of the sun above the horizon. One may manipulate
shadow length by altering the last two factors and this will not
affect pole height. See Hausman, 1998 and Woodward, 2003.

For a similar observation, see Psillos, 2002. Notice, though, that
although this rationale yields an account of why it
is <em>desirable</em> to construct explanations appealing to laws
(when this is possible), it isn't clear that yields the result that
explanation always <em>requires</em> laws. Perhaps there are
generalizations that unify sufficiently to qualify as explanatory,
according to the unificationist account, but do not count as laws
according to the MRL account.  Kitcher's version of the unficationist
model seems to admit this as a possibility.
