<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Intergenerational Justice</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a> In the following I will
speak of moral rights rather than legitimate claims, but nothing
hinges on this as long as it is understood that having a legitimate
claim implies another person or persons standing under the correlative
duty to respond to the claim.</p>


<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> See, for example,
Birnbacher (1988), 140&ndash;72, 175&ndash;79; Jonas&rsquo; notion of a &ldquo;Heuristik
der Furcht&rdquo; (heuristics of fear) in (1979), 63&ndash;64. Another issue
is whether we have reasons to discount the future in the sense of
discounting future persons&rsquo; well-being. See, for example, Cowen and
Parfit (1992); Broome (1994).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> Partly due to these
features as well as the unchangeable asymmetry in power-relations
between currently living people and remote future generations,
currently living people&rsquo;s compliance with their obligations to remote
future people is likely to be less reliable. See Birnbacher
(2008).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> See Section 4 for a
sufficientarian interpretation of future people&rsquo;s welfare rights
vis-&agrave;-vis currently living people.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> See Heyd (1992),
chs. 1 and 4. Whether future people can be said to and have a right to
non-existence under certain circumstances is the central issue of
&ldquo;wrongful life&rdquo; cases, which are to be distinguished from
both &ldquo;wrongful birth&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrongful pregnancy&rdquo;
cases. The latter two concern interests of <em>parents</em> in not
giving birth to a defective child and in not having an unwanted
pregnancy, respectively. &ldquo;Wrongful life&rdquo; cases concern the
interests of <em>children</em> in not being brought into existence
under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> On how to understand
the relevant threshold see Section 4 below.  To define such a threshold
we do not have to compare the value of such a life with the value of
non-existence (see nn. 16&ndash;17 and accompanying text).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> It is beyond the scope
of the entry to work out an interpretation of harm that specifies the
necessary and sufficient conditions for wrongful harming.  See
Feinberg (n. 18 below).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> Parfit (1984), part
iv, and especially ch. 17.; see the contributions in Ryberg and T&auml;nnsj&ouml; (2004); entry on
the
 <a href="../repugnant-conclusion/">repugnant conclusion</a>).
</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> It is worth pointing
out that there are, plausibly, at least some future persons whose
existence and identity is altogether independent of our actions
(although this claim may be implausible in the case of public policy
choices). For example, somebody now set a booby-trap that would cause
harm to some future persons. Performing the action may harm the bodily
integrity of future people who will live quite independently of his
having performed the action and thus the contingency of future
persons&rsquo; existence on present actions can in no way exempt this
particular action from moral condemnation. Many contributions on what
we owe to future people concentrate on what Parfit calls &ldquo;same
people choices&rdquo; ((1984), 355&ndash;56), <em>i.e.</em>, such
decision-situations in which we assume that future people&rsquo;s existence,
identity and number are not contingent upon our decisions.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> For the distinctions
see Parfit (1984), 487&ndash;90; Woodward (1986), 818; Morreim (1988), 23;
Fishkin (1991); Fishkin (1992), 63&ndash;64; Shiffrin (1999). For the
wording of these notions of harm see Pogge (2003).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> For a defense of the
view that certain types of inactions, namely omissions, can be harmful
see, e.g., Feinberg (1984), ch. 4 and Birnbacher (1995), chs. 3&ndash;5.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> The formulation may be
misleading in suggesting that by <em>t</em><sub>2</sub> we refer to a
moment of a person&rsquo;s life. Rather, the notions of harm as
distinguished in this entry should be understood to allow for
differing interpretations of the relevant unit of well-being (e.g.,
the life of the affected person as a whole or future periods of her
life). For discussions of how to interpret and measure the well-being
of people see Griffin (1986), part i; Hurka (1993), ch. 6; Scanlon
(1998), ch. 3.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> &ldquo;Acted with
respect to this person&rdquo; is meant to include the act that causes
this person&rsquo;s existence. It is difficult to interpret such acts as
<em>inter</em>actions. We prefer &ldquo;had we not interacted with (or
acted with respect to) this person at all&rdquo; to David Gauthier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;in our absence&rdquo; (Gauthier (1986), 203&ndash;05). Both
formulations are problematic and it is beyond the scope of this entry
to discuss their respective problems at length. Gauthier himself
points out that his formulation runs into difficulty in dealing with
situations in which a person has assumed a certain social role, e.g.,
the role of a life-guard that is, in part, defined by positive duties
vis-&agrave;-vis others. If a person assumes such a role her
&ldquo;absence&rdquo; in a situation where she is duty-bound to
intervene can render the situation of others worse (ibid., 205). For
the formulation we prefer it seems plausible to suggest that assuming
such a role does constitute an &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; of the then
duty-bound person with those to whom she is bound where fulfilling the
duties of her role is concerned.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> See Roberts
(1998).&mdash;A probabilistic and a necessarian reading of future
people&rsquo;s contingency upon our actions can be distinguished (see
Parfit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Time-Dependence Claim&rdquo; ((1984), 351&ndash;52) and,
thus, of the scope of the non-identity problem.  According to the
necessarian reading it matters that the same person or people could
have existed had we not carried out the act or policy.  Whether it is
in fact likely or unlikely to have happened does not matter. According
to the probabilistic reading, if it was extremely unlikely and the
probability was close to zero, it is reasonable to hold that the same
person would not have existed. The latter view can be attributed to
Parfit ((1984), 352). For discussion whether it normatively matters
that genetically identical people can be brought about by different
acts and under different circumstances, see Simmons (1995), 178&ndash;79;
Roberts (1998), sects. 3.4 and 3.5.; Gosseries (2004), ch. ii.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> This is why this type
of notion of harm is also called identity-independent. See Fishkin
(1991); Fishkin (1992), 63&ndash;64.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> This is assuming that
to compare an existing person&rsquo;s current state of well-being with the
state of this person had the person not been conceived is to compare
an existing person&rsquo;s current state with this person&rsquo;s &ldquo;never
existing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a> How to compare the
value of prenatal nonexistence with death for a living person is a
different issue. See Kamm (1993), 36; Raz (2001), 90&ndash;92.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> Feinberg (1984), 102,
suggests that the inapplicability of notion (II) precludes
&ldquo;criminal liability for &lsquo;wrongful
conception&rsquo;&rdquo;.  According to Feinberg, in the context of
the criminal law &ldquo;harming someone&rdquo; should presuppose
worsening a person&rsquo;s condition, i.e. setting back a person&rsquo;s
interests. Thus, Feinberg does not consider our notion (III) a notion
of harm to be applied in delineating criminal liability. However, in
his analysis the afflicted child in wrongful life cases was
&ldquo;wronged&rdquo; (ibid. and 34&ndash;35) by having been deprived of his
&ldquo;birth rights&rdquo; (ibid., 99) and &ldquo;the wrongful
progenitors &hellip; should &hellip; be held civilly liable to pay
damages to the child&rdquo; (ibid., 102).  Feinberg (1990), 327,
proposes &ldquo;a clear categorical exception&rdquo; to his (liberal)
interpretation of the criminal law for &ldquo;malicious or reckless
conceptions&rdquo;, i.e., cases in which a child is &ldquo;born with a
serious and permanent impairment&mdash;though not one that is so
serious that the child would prefer even nonexistence to 
it&mdash;&rdquo; (325) and the parents could have easily avoided having a child
in an impaired condition. Feinberg suggests that such cases
&ldquo;<em>can</em> in principle be legitimately proscribed by the
criminal law even though they harm no one in the sense required by the
harm principle.&rdquo; (327) See ibid., 27&ndash;33.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> This is a variation of
Derek Parfit&rsquo;s example of &ldquo;The 14&ndash;Year-Old Girl&rdquo;. See
Parfit (1984), 358, 364.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> See Parfit&rsquo;s
&ldquo;same number quality claim&rdquo; (principle Q) in Parfit
(1984), 360; Kavka (1982), 98&ndash;99.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a> See notes 16&ndash;18 and
accompanying text.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a> Even if one accepted
the subjunctive-different-person understanding of harm (IV) for same
number cases, this would not provide a solution in the different
number cases. See Parfit (1984), part iv.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> Further, only if this person would not be in the harmed state had the agent not interacted with (or acted with respect to) this person at all; and furthermore, if the agent cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, does not minimize the harm (see the threshold notion of harm as introduced above in Section 3.1).</p>

<p>
As indicated below (in Section 4. and, in particular, in 4.3) if the agent cannot avoid causing sub-threshold harm he or she should minimize the harm in accordance with a prioritarian assessment of the alternative options open to the agent.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a> Please note three points: First, in describing the disjunctive notion it is superfluous to consider the diachronic notion (I). When the subjunctive-historical notion (II) is applicable, notion (I) is applicable as well; the diachronic notion (I) is applicable when counterfactual considerations play no role in the application of notion (II).</p>
<p>Second, not only our (IV) as stated above fulfills this requirement. Any disjunctive notion that entails notion of harm at (III) as a necessary  condition for causing harm will fulfill this requirement. Thomas Pogge suggested to me an understanding of the disjunctive notion that gives priority to the subjunctive-historical notion of harm: (IV*) Having acted in a certain way (or having forborne from acting in that way) at a time t1, we thereby harm someone only if either (II) we cause this person to be worse off at some later time t2 than the person would have been at t2 had we not interacted with this person at all; or this test is inapplicable and (III) we cause this person to be in a sub-threshold state of well-being, and, if we cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, do not minimize the harm. For discussion see nn. 25 and 28.</p>
<p>Third, it is worth pointing out that there are other reasons for preferring the disjunctive over the single notion. The disjunctive notion is compatible with the central understanding of harm and compensation as these notions are normally understood in tort law. In cases which do not involve the non-identity problem and in which the harmful act reduces the well-being of the victim to a level that is still above the threshold, the comparative notion of harm provides the relevant standard for restitution and compensation.</p>


<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> According to (IV*)
(see n. 24) only one set of conditions (as specified by each reading
of harm) can obtain. (IV*) might also imply that it makes a moral
difference which test we cancel: It might well make a moral difference
which reason we have for objecting to cancel either test.  However,
(IV*) will not give us two reasons for objecting to canceling
pregnancy testing. Thus, we could not interpret the supposed
difference in terms of there being two reasons for objecting to
canceling the pregnancy testing and just one reason for objecting to
canceling preconception testing.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a> It is assumed here
that in the context of taking a decision on whether or not to treat
the fetuses, the fetuses are actual future people (see Section 2).  In
other words, the treatment of the fetuses will not have compositional
effects as might be induced by post-conception genetic
interventions. For the feasibility of such post-conception genetic
therapy and surgery and their implications for interpreting wrongful
life claims, see Buchanan, Brock, Daniels, and Wikler (2000), 6 and
ch.  6. If pregnancy testing leads to post-conception intervention
that has compositional effects, Parfit&rsquo;s two medical programs become
indistinguishable with respect to the applicability of the comparative
notion of harm.</p> 

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a> For the distinction
between and a discussion of these two versions of the No-Difference
View, see Woodward (1986), sects. II and III; Parfit, (1986),
856&ndash;59.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a> Note that (IV*) (see
n. 24) is also incompatible with the theoretical reading of the
No-Difference View: According to (IV*) we have different (but not
additional) reasons for objecting to the harming of actual people.</p>


<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a> Whether we wrongfully
inflict non-comparative harms on a person by causing this person&rsquo;s
existence is often considered a special case for which a particularly
low threshold is relevant: we cause such harm by bringing a person to
existence only if this person&rsquo;s postnatal potential of development and
his life span are drastically reduced (Kavka (1982), 105&ndash;06) and
especially so if the person experiences pain (Harris (1991), 65&ndash;66;
Sch&ouml;ne-Seifert and Kr&uuml;ger (1993), 257&ndash;58; Merkel (2001)).
However, Shiffrin (1999) suggests that causing people to exist is
prima facie objectionable regardless of the particular identity of the
person (and for a similar view see Benatar (2006)): Since causing
someone to exist always causes the person to have interests that will
be frustrated and since the frustration of some of these interests is
attributable to the act that caused the person&rsquo;s existence, causing a
person to exist always inflicts some non-comparative harms. In her
understanding this is objectionable because the person cannot consent
and these harms are not necessary to prevent a greater harm. If this
is to violate the person&rsquo;s right and this fact cannot be outweighed or
justified by the goods that the person is also caused to have, then it
is objectionable to have caused the person to exist.</p>


<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a> This would be the case
since equality is of intrinsic value. For discussion see
Marmor (2003); Steiner (2003); and Raz&rsquo;s response (2003). See also
Gosepath (2004), 454&ndash;63; Holtug and Lippert-Rasmussen (2007) and the entry on
 <a href="../equality/">equality</a>)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a> The so-called
leveling-down objection is the best known objection to monistic value
egalitarianism. For a recent analysis and discussion, see
Lippert-Rasmussen (2007). A monistic value egalitarianism will also
have unacceptable implications when applied to contemporaries: the
state of affairs in which all have lives barely worth living is to be
preferred to in which all have good or very good lives but some are
better off than others.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a> See Section 4.4 below
on Rawls&rsquo; savings principle. Rawls (2001), 159, proposes a duty to
save positively &ldquo;to make possible the conditions needed to establish
and to preserve a just basic structure over time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a> Compare, penultimate paragraph of subsection 4.2. This can be an implication of both the
priority view and the position of weak sufficientarianism even if the
number of people to be considered is fixed; thus, it can arise in
situations involving contemporaries only, as noted by Casal for the
priority view in her (2007), 319&ndash;20; and see Mulgan (2006),
66&ndash;79. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a> The most promising
approach for justifying a priority threshold can be seen in relying
upon the distinction between needs and (mere) wishes. Here a short
sketch of the argument may suffice (see also Benbaji (2005), 324&ndash;326): If person <em>X</em> has the need
for something (needs something) that person <em>Y</em> wishes to have
but does not need, then, <em>prima facie</em>, we ought to fulfil the
needs of person <em>X</em>. But how do we distinguish between needs
and mere wishes?  Whether a need deserves the moral priority as
indicated depends entirely upon whether the needy person would be not
well off if the need in question were not fulfilled. Thus, an
interpretation of the moral significance of needs suggests the
commitment to a morally privileged priority line of well-being. If
person <em>X</em> has the need for something that person <em>Y</em>
wishes to have but does not need&mdash;in the sense that person
<em>X</em> would not be well off if his need were not fulfilled but
person <em>Y</em> would still be well off if his wish were not
fulfilled&mdash;, then fulfilling the need of person <em>X</em> is
<em>prima facie</em> more important than fulfilling the wish of
<em>Y</em>. Of course, we would have to defend the argument as
sketched against a good number of objections. Additionally, we would
have to show that the argument would justify a substantial threshold
that has absolute priority.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a> On the notion of
well-ordered (liberal) societies, see Rawls (2001), 8&ndash;9, and Rawls
(1999), part I.&mdash;It is a different matter whether the oft-cited
reasons for a sufficientarian understanding of global justice (see
entry on
 <a href="../international-justice/">international distributive justice</a>) are relevant to an understanding of
intergenerational relations and whether they, in fact, speak more
strongly on behalf of an sufficientarian conception of
intergenerational relations than on behalf of such a conception of
international relations.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-36" name="36">36.</a> But see Rawls
(rev. edition 1999), 140&ndash;41. Rawls already alludes to a
sufficientarian understanding by claiming not only that the parties of
the original position would rationally prefer average utility over the
classical (sum-maximizing) principle but would &ldquo;agree to some sort of
floor to hold up average welfare&rdquo; (ibid., 141).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-37" name="37">37.</a> Rawls (1971), 291. For
a critique of this claim see Gosseries (2001), 318&ndash;19. For a critique
of Rawls&rsquo;s related claim, namely, that the difference principle is
inapplicable in the transnational context (Rawls (1999), 113&ndash;20), see
Pogge, (1994), especially 211&ndash;14.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a> Rawls (1993), 274,
fn. 12. For criticisms of his proposal in (1971), see Hubin (1976/77),
70&ndash;83; English, (1977), 91&ndash;104; Heyd (1992), 41&ndash;51.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-39" name="39">39.</a> Rawls does not discuss
the question of whether, and in what ways, the just savings principle
might be sensitive to the number of people who will live in the 
future&mdash;however, how many people will live in the future seems clearly
to matter for determining how much we should save. See Heyd (1992),
47; Dasgupta (1994); Casal and Williams (1995); Barry (1999), 107&ndash;11;
Gosseries (2001), 330&ndash;33. The just savings principle could indirectly
be sensitive to the number of future people: it would at the very
least be unjust to choose those further futures in which more people
exist than there are resources for just institutions. By not
discussing the relevance of the number of future people for the
specification of the just savings rate, Rawls might best be understood
to have bracketed the non-identity problem. Nor has Rawls addressed
the question of how we should respond to the impact of past
generations&rsquo; not having saved at just rates. See Dasgupta (1994),
107&ndash;08.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a> See n. 29
above.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a> However, this will
depend upon the substantive content of the conception of
non-comparative harm. One can hold the view that currently living
people&rsquo;s concerns for the well-being of actual future people are fully
captured by the substantive content of the conception of
non-comparative harm. But see Section 4.</p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a> I do not exclude
the possibility of people standing under some obligation to procreate
out of regard for the interests of actual (presently living or future)
people. Also, admittedly, it is hard to imagine that we could ever be
in a position in which we relate to future life on earth simply as a
matter of our procreational choice without there being interests of
actual future people to be taken into account. One reason is that to
date in many, if not most cases procreation is not the consequence of
choice. </p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a> For the claims of
descendants of slaves in the USA see, for example, Bedau (1972);
Boxill (1992); Brooks (1999), parts 6 and 7; Soyinka (1999), 44&ndash;69;
Fullinwider (2000); Lyons (2004b); Miller and Kumar (2007). For an
analysis of the relevance of historical injustice for claims of groups
to political self-determination or autonomy see, for example, Buchanan
(1991); Brilmayer (1991); Thompson (1990); Kymlicka (1999); Gans
(2001); Miller and Kumar
(2007).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a> People can be harmed
by events, say, by a natural catastrophe. The following reasoning
applies when such an event occurs before the person who makes the
claim to being compensated owing to the event comes into
existence.</p>

<p> 

 <a href="index.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a> We cannot rely on the
diachronic notion at (II) either. It presupposes that we can attribute
a state of well-being to the descendant at the time his or her
ancestors are being wronged. However, currently living African
Americans might well have just claims to compensation based on the
subjunctive-historical notion of harm because harm done to them or to
their more recent ancestors. See Lyons&rsquo; analysis of continuing
discrimination against African Americans in Lyons (2004a).</p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-46" name="46">46.</a> The relevance and
importance of the forward-looking assessment of the normative
significance of past wrongs has been stressed by, for example, Lyons
(1977); Waldron (1992b); Ackerman (1992), 72&ndash;73; Ackerman (1997). For a
theory of justice that grounds our obligations in backward-looking
reasoning see Nozick ((1974), 152&ndash;53). The theory relies upon
counterfactual reasoning. For critique see Lyons (1977); Sher (1981);
Waldron (1992b). For epistemic reasons only, Nozick proposes Rawls&rsquo;s
difference principle&mdash;a forward-looking principle, specifying
what the future should be like&mdash;as a &ldquo;rough rule of thumb
for rectifying&rdquo; historical injustice ((1974), 231). This idea
does not address the problem of the inapplicability of a
non-comparative notion of harm as discussed in the text. For
alternative <em>impersonal</em> interpretations of how the past
matters normatively, see Vallentyne (1988); Hill (1990/91); Feldman
(1997), chs. 1, 4.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a> Assuming we
could know what that state would be.  See Sher (1981).</p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a> Here we are not
concerned with pragmatic reasons for, e.g., the statutes of
limitations and the doctrine of adverse possession. See Marmor (2004),
326&ndash;29.</p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-49" name="49">49.</a> Or, as Lyons
puts it in (1977), 370: &ldquo;property rights themselves, and not just
their exercise or contents, are relative to circumstances&rdquo;.</p>

<p> 

<a href="index.html#note-50" name="50">50.</a> See Waldron
(1992b), 24; Waldron (2004), 67&ndash;71. The supersession thesis concerns
the ongoing effect of past injustices only. Claiming that injustices
are superseded implies neither that the past unjust violations of
rights were not unjust nor that they should no longer be considered
unjust. Even if certain injustices are superseded, we may well stand
under obligations to publicly acknowledge the wrongs committed and to
provide, say, symbolic reparations toward the victims. See
sects. 5.3 and 5.4 below.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-51" name="51">51.</a> &ldquo;Das
vergangene Unrecht ist geschehen und abgeschlossen. Die Erschlagenen
sind wirklich erschlagen.&rdquo; In a letter to Walter Benjamin 1937,
as quoted in Tiedemann (1983), 107.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-52" name="52">52.</a> Partridge (1981a),
259&ndash;61, discusses the example of Alfred Nobel and defends a
rule-utilitarian reading of death-bed promises.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-53" name="53">53.</a> For a comparison of
the memorials for the victims of the Shoa in Poland, Germany and
Israel, see Young (1989), 1799&ndash;811. See Winter (1995) for an interpretation of the memorials of the First World War. Of course, public commemorations may be put to the use of (re-)affirming values that differ from the values that many people participating in the acts of symbolic compensation may wish to express. See, e.g., Scarre (2014).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-54" name="54">54.</a> Anderson (1993)
provides a theory of expressive reasoning and the relation between
expressive reasoning and consequentialist reasoning.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-55" name="55">55.</a> &ldquo;Never
again!&rdquo;&mdash;which is also the title of the reports of the
Argentine (1984) truth commission, of the report that was secretly
prepared in Brazil (1985) as well as of the Uruguayan report of
non-governmental organizations (1989). See Nino (1996), 78&ndash;82;
Weschler (1990), part i, and 235.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-56" name="56">56.</a> For example, the
Roma (Gypsies) were victims of a racially motivated genocide committed
by the Nazis&mdash;a truth that has been long denied with the result
that most surviving victims as well as the descendants of those
murdered were excluded from compensation and restitution.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-57" name="57">57.</a> See, e.g., Thompson
(2002) who discusses the reasons for attributing such an obligation to
current members of ongoing political societies (e.g., states) whose
previous members committed egregious wrongs in the name of the society
and with harmful consequences for currently living people.</p>
