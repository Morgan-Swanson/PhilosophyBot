<h2>A Taxonomy of Theoretical Work in Bioethics</h2>

<p>

For those who wish to delve deeper into the subject of theory in
bioethics, I offer here a discursive taxonomy of the various sorts of
inquiries that might plausibly be labeled &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo;
within the big tent of bioethics. Rather than attempting a serviceable
definition of theory&mdash;or a list of reliable criteria&mdash;up
front, we'll review a number of theoretical inquiries in
bioethics and list <em>en passant</em> whatever crucial defining
features they might suggest.</p>


<h3>1. Rooting out bad theory</h3>

<p>

There is a use for theory that even the most anti-theoretical
commentators have endorsed: viz., countering all the bad, implicit
theory that infects so much public discussion of bioethical matters.
Even if we follow Robert Fullinwider's (2007) advice to eschew
theory in favor of common morality, actual social practices and
institutional norms as our primary sources of practical moral
reasoning, we will surely find, as Fullinwider warns, that those very
practices and norms are riddled with &ldquo;bad theory&rdquo; or
&ldquo;metaphysical baloney&rdquo; of all kinds, much of it stemming
from provincial social attitudes and uncritical religious
 beliefs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
Since
cataloguing the vast expanse of bad metaphysics and moral theory
embedded in past bioethical debates would itself require an entire
encyclopedia entry, I will limit myself here to just a couple of
examples, chosen more or less at random.</p>

<p>

<em>Cost-effectiveness analysis</em>. Although there is no doubt
that cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be an extremely useful tool
or adjunct in setting health care priorities, there is plenty of reason
to be skeptical when CEA operates, as it often does in health policy
circles, as unquestioned dogma regarding the sole proper criterion for
allocating of health resources. As a direct offshoot of welfare
economics and ultimately of utilitarian moral theory, CEA is premised
on the notion that justice in the distribution of health-related goods
is equivalent to the maximization of benefits or, more colloquially
put, to getting the most bang for the health care buck. While such
formulations have the ring of common sense about them, and while
economists often write and speak as though there were no rational
alternatives to CEA (Eddy 1996), philosophers know all-too-well that
utilitarian theories of justice are highly controversial at best, and
fatally flawed at worst. By focusing exclusively on the maximization of
benefits, no matter the fairness of their distribution, utilitarian
theory ignores other factors, such as claims of equity on behalf of
worst off groups, that many people regard as highly relevant to just
outcomes. In this case, the proper response to bad (or at least
controversial) theory is not to banish theory from bioethics, but
rather to propose a better theory, one that directly addresses issues
of equity or fairness in the distribution of goods. (Brock 2004)</p>

<p>

(b) Muddled distinctions. During the emergence of contemporary
bioethics, decisions to forego life-sustaining treatments were often
framed by doctors, lawyers and the public at large in terms of
well-worn distinctions between ordinary vs. extraordinary treatments,
actions vs. omissions, and killing vs. letting die. Physicians often
justified their actions (e.g., withdrawing a ventilator or feeding
tube) on the ground that a particular treatment constituted an
&ldquo;extraordinary means;&rdquo; and in response to worries that
withholding or withdrawal a tube might kill the patient, they often
claimed that they were &ldquo;merely omitting&rdquo; to do something,
rather than <em>doing</em> something illicit. But as a devastating
report, drafted by philosophers, showed in 1983, such distinctions were
inherently vague and tended to focus on morally irrelevant features of
such cases (President's Commission 1983). When a physician pulls
a feeding tube, is she &ldquo;merely omitting&rdquo; to do something,
which would presumably be licit, or is she actually doing something,
i.e., removing the tube, which would presumably be illicit? Apart from
this sort of terminal vagueness, philosophers helpfully pointed out
that the moral permissibility of such life and death decisions should
rest, not on such metaphysically dubious and morally irrelevant
distinctions, but rather, inter alia, on the likely impact of a
proposed treatment (or treatment withdrawal) on the patient's
overall well-being.</p>

<h3>2. Normative theory</h3>


<h4>2.1 Normative Ethical Theory</h4> 

<p>

The most obvious example of theoretical work in bioethics fits under
the traditional rubric of &ldquo;normative ethical theory.&rdquo; The
point of this kind of theoretical work is most often to justify one's
judgments bearing on the rightness or wrongness of various individual
actions or social policies. Should Doctor Dan lie to his patient in
order to facilitate her recovery or induce her to accept what he
regards as beneficial surgery? Should the various states legally
permit physician-assisted suicide? Who should have first priority on
scarce vaccines in the face of pandemic influenza?</p>

<p>

If we rule out the use of force in imposing answers to such
questions, we must engage in the social practice of offering,
accepting, and criticizing what we take to be good reasons for our
judgments bearing on actions and social policies. While appeals to
common sense and standard practices will suffice most of the time, we
are often driven to higher levels of moral discourse in order to give a
satisfactory justification of our judgments in the face of disagreement
and controversy. In working out solutions to the three practical
questions posed above, we might begin to wonder about the weight that
should be given to consequences versus that given to various
commonsensical but non-consequentialist moral obligations, such as
truth-telling, respecting human life, or human equality. In doing so,
we are already fully engaged in the project of normative ethical theory
building. Typical examples of such theory in bioethics include
consequentialism in its various incarnations, including utilitarianism
(Singer 1999); contractualism, including Rawlsian theories of justice
(Rawls 1971/1999; Kantian-style deontology (Donagan 1977), and
libertarian political thought (Engelhardt 1996).</p>

<h4>2.2 Virtue ethics</h4>

<p> Apart from setting out the grounds and scope of moral our
obligations and of ethically permissible conduct and policy, normative
ethics also deals with questions bearing on what kind of people we
should be. Instead of focusing on the grounds and criteria of right
and wrong conduct (i.e., the <em>what</em> of ethics), virtue ethics
focuses on the quality of moral agency (or the <em>who</em> of
ethics). This variety of ethical theory ponders the nature of the
virtues and their manifestation in virtuous moral agents. In
bioethics, virtue ethics has often focused on the virtues of the good
physician or nurse, including conscientiousness, technical skill,
empathy, courage, truthfulness, dedication to the patient's good, and
justice (Pellegrino 1993, Drane 1995).</p>

<h4>2.3 High moral theory</h4>

<p> Normative ethical theories vary considerably in terms of their
aspirations towards generalization, universality, abstractness,
systematic organization, simplicity, and comprehensiveness (Nussbaum
2000, Flynn 2007). Paradigmatic examples of what we'll call
&ldquo;high moral theory&rdquo; attempt to embody most or all of these
defining characteristics. Thus classical utilitarianism, Kantian
deontology, and Rawlsian justice as fairness, for example, all strive
for the articulation of a theoretical system based upon a small number
of abstract fundamental principles (e.g., Mill's principle of utility,
Kant's categorical imperative, and Rawls's famous two principles of
justice) that they regard as the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to understanding
the moral or political life.  These principles in their pristine
incarnations are capable of being articulated in a perfectly general
and universal fashion without any reference to or dependency upon any
particular social practices or cultural norms. They apply, so their
authors tell us, to all rational agents as
such.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
Beginning from these highly abstract and universally binding moral
norms, standard examples of high moral theory ramify into complex
systems encompassing basic and derivative moral principles (e.g.,
respect the autonomy of rational agents), rules based upon such
principles (e.g., do not enlist patients in biomedical research
without first gaining their informed consent), and, finally, judgments
animated by such principles and rules bearing on particular cases
(e.g., the Tuskegee syphilis study was unethical).</p>

<p>

Although most philosophers might naturally think of such highly
abstract and ambitious constructions as paradigmatic examples of moral
theory, and most likely have precisely such theories in mind when asked
about the relationships between bioethics and ethical theory, they do
not exhaust the space of normative theorizing either in bioethics or
within the moral life more generally.</p>

<h4>2.4 Pluralistic theories</h4>

<p> In contrast to typical high, vaulting theory supported by a single
keystone, more pluralistic ethical theories also purport to offer
normative bases for moral thought but with more broad-based
foundations. In addition to the principle of utility or categorical
imperative, such theories consist of a set of fairly heterogeneous
moral principles or basic capabilities necessary for human flourishing
and/or ethical behavior. One classical example of this genre of moral
theory can be found in the work of British philosopher W.D. Ross,
whose list of so-called prima facie, obligations&mdash;fidelity;
reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and
self-improvement&mdash;clearly anticipated and inspired the dominant
&ldquo;principlist&rdquo; approach to bioethics championed by
Beauchamp and Childress. (Ross 1988, Brody 1988, Frankena 1973)</p>

<p>

Importantly, these pluralistic theorists generally refrain from
endorsing an a priori ranking&mdash;or, as Rawls puts it, a
&lsquo;lexical ordering&rsquo;&mdash;of the various interests, values
and principles they articulate. Autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for
example, might all figure in our deliberations about a particular
issue, but their respective weight or importance can only be determined
<em>in medias res</em>, given all the particularities of the case at
hand. Gauging which values, principles or rules should determine the
result in a particular case is said to require good judgment, practical
wisdom, or intuition of some sort.</p>

<p>

Another, very different approach to pluralistic normative theory is
developed in the related political theories of Martha Nussbaum and A.K.
Sen. (Nussbaum 2000, Sen 1999) Instead of plumbing the depths of our
common morality for deontological obligations in the manner of Ross,
Beauchamp and Childress, Nussbaum offers us a neo-Aristotelian theory
of the prerequisites of human well-being or flourishing. In contrast to
others within the big Rawlsian tent who would measure progress on
achieving equality by focusing on the resources or primary goods held
by individuals, both Nussbaum and Sen explicate the &ldquo;metric of
equality&rdquo; as the measure of what individuals are able &ldquo;to
be and do.&rdquo; Towards this end, Nussbaum (but not Sen) has
developed a list of 10 basic capabilities required for a life that is
truly commensurate with human dignity:</p>

<ol>

<li>Being able to live a life of normal length.</li>

<li>Having adequate bodily health and shelter.</li>

<li>Bodily integrity.</li>

<li>Being able to use one's senses, imagination, and thought; to
experience pleasure and avoid pain.</li>

<li>Emotional expression and development.</li>

<li>Practical reason, being able to critically reflect on one's own
life, liberty of conscience.</li>

<li>Affiliation with others and possessing equal dignity in society.</li>

<li>Other species. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to
animals, plants, and the world of nature.</li>

<li>Play. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational
activities.</li>

<li>Control over
one's environment, both politically and materially.</li>

</ol>

<p>

According to Nussbaum, all of these basic capabilities are crucial
prerequisites of human flourishing, and none should be traded away for
more of the others. This kind of pluralistic moral/political theory has
gained considerable traction in the areas of public health and global
bioethics (Powers and Faden 2006).</p>

<p>

These pluralistic accounts of normative theory frequently
encountered in bioethics usually feature the selective appropriation of
various themes or theory fragments borrowed from elements featured in
standard high-level theories (Baker and McCullough 2007). The so-called
principle of autonomy provides an interesting case in point. As
articulated in some of the foundational documents of the contemporary
bioethics movement, such as the seminal <em>Belmont Report</em> on the
ethics of research with human subjects, and Beauchamp and
Childress's <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics</em>, the
principle of autonomy was put to work in the highly successful battle
against a well-entrenched medical paternalism that arrogated decision
making prerogatives to physicians and biomedical researchers.
(President's Commission 1978, Beauchamp and Childress 1977). The
interesting thing about this principle of autonomy or &ldquo;respect
for persons&rdquo; is that it seems to have been cobbled together from
a variety of theoretical sources (Beauchamp 2007). Clearly, the
principle has unmistakable Kantian overtones. Respect for the moral
autonomy of persons is an absolutely fundamental element of Kantian
moral theory. But the contemporary understanding of autonomy within the
field of bioethics has been distinctly unKantian in its jettisoning of
Kant's metaphysics of action and his key distinction between
autonomy, defined as allegiance to universal and rational moral law,
and heteronomy, defined as the determination of action by
&ldquo;mere&rdquo; individually defined interests. So in spite of the
distinct Kantian flavor of a term like &ldquo;respect for
persons&rdquo; in the bioethics literature, usually all that remains of
the Kantian understanding of autonomy in this field is a broadly
defined notion of self-rule or individual choice that is equally
compatible with a Millian notion of liberty and with what Kant would
have deemed heteronomous springs of action.</p>

<p>

Thus, in addition to this Kantian strain in the contemporary
bioethical understanding of autonomy, there are distinctly utilitarian
or consequentialist motifs borrowed from such works as J.S.
Mill's <em>On Liberty</em> and more fully developed by Gerald
Dworkin (1972) and Joel Feinberg (1986). One of the bioethicists'
strongest arguments against medical paternalism turned out to be the
distinctly Millian, rule-utilitarian claim that when it comes to
self-regarding choices bearing on medical treatments, paternalistic
interventions by physicians will almost always do more harm than good,
if not in the short run then at least in the long run as a matter of
standard medical practice and social policy. Such fragmentary
appropriation of elements drawn from high moral theory is ubiquitous in
the field of bioethics.</p>

<h4>2.5 Convergence theories</h4>

<p> A similarly eclectic approach to high moral theory stresses the
convergence of differing theories at the level of action guiding
principles. No matter what the differences between, say, utilitarian
consequentialism and Kantian deontology at the highest level, it is
sometimes claimed that such rival theories will predictably reach the
same results both at the level of mid-level principles and at the
concrete level of particular judgments. One well-known example of this
phenomenon is provided by Beauchamp, who described himself as a
rule-utilitarian, and Childress, who described himself as a partisan
of religious deontology, in early iterations of their highly
influential joint project on the principles of biomedical
ethics. Despite their differences at the level of foundational moral
theory, both of these philosophers expected their ultimate differences
to recede at the level of moral principles, where they could agree,
for example, on the importance of the principle of autonomy and its
overriding significance in the area of research ethics and the
physician-patient relationship, even if their ultimate justifications
at the level of high moral theory would tend to diverge (2009,
361-63).</p>

<h4>2.6 Common morality theories</h4>

<p>

Two rival &ldquo;common morality&rdquo; theories, elaborated
respectively by Beauchamp &amp; Childress and Bernard Gert, currently
dominate the field of bioethics (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, Gert
2006, Arras 2009). Whereas pluralistic moral theories are defined in
terms of the number and kind of basic moral norms they defend, common
morality theories focus on the ultimate <em>source</em> of our
principles, rules, and ideals. Both of these approaches trace that
source to a common morality supposedly shared by all people of good
will. Such theories are, however, also decidedly pluralist insofar as
they encompass moral rules, principles and ideals that address a host
of disparate consequentialist and deontological moral concerns bearing
on killing, lying, beneficence, justice,
 etc.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Beginning with the third edition of the <em>Principles of Biomedical
Ethics</em>, published in 1989, Beauchamp and Childress relocated the
source of their mid-level bioethical principles from high philosophical
theory to what they have termed &lsquo;&lsquo;the common
morality.&rsquo;&rsquo; By insisting on the definite article
here, they meant to distinguish the wide variety of particular
moralities found in different eras, cultures, and professions from
their source in a morality that is common, as they put it, to all
persons in all times and places who are committed to living a moral
life. This morality encompasses both rules of obligation (e.g., do not
kill or cause suffering for others, tell the truth, keep promises, do
not steal, prevent evil or harm from occurring, rescue persons in
danger, do not punish the innocent, obey the law, treat all persons
with equal moral consideration, etc.) and standards of moral character,
such as nonmalevolence, honesty, integrity, truthfulness,
fidelity, lovingness, and kindness.</p>

<p>

Beauchamp and Childress assert that the content of the common morality
is dictated by the primary objectives of morality, which include the
amelioration of human misery, the avoidance of premature death, and
the predictable consequences of indifference, conflict, hostility,
scarce resources, limited information, and so on. Adhering to the
norms of the common morality is necessary, Beauchamp claims, &ldquo;to
counteract the tendency for the quality of people's lives to worsen or
for social relationships to disintegrate&rdquo; (Beauchamp 2003, p.
261).</p>

<p>

The moral authority of the common morality is thus established,
according to Beauchamp and Childress, neither by means of ethical
theory nor by means of a priori reasoning or reflection on the
meaning of moral terms; rather, moral normativity is established
historically or pragmatically through the success of these norms in
all times and places in advancing the cause of human
flourishing. Their account is thus historicist, but unlike most
historicisms it does not embrace moral relativism. The norms of the
common morality, they insist, are universally binding.</p>

<p>

Providing a mere thumbnail sketch of Bernard Gert's approach to common
morality will prove to be a much more daunting task because, in
contrast to Beauchamp and Childress, Gert's primary contribution to
ethics and practical ethics <em>just is</em> his account of common
morality. More specifically, Gert begins with a conception of
the point and purpose of morality, which then yields the descriptive
core of common morality, including lists of the various moral rules
and moral ideals, and a decision procedure for determining when it is
justified to violate any of the moral rules. This descriptive
core is then shored up by Gert's <em>theory</em> of common morality,
which attempts to provide a justification for the entire
edifice. Although Gert concedes that his particular theory of
common morality might well be problematic in various ways, although he
doubts it, he insists that his account of the descriptive content of
common morality is both true and universally embraced by all rational
persons. For Gert, then, the point of &lsquo;&lsquo;doing
ethics&rsquo;&rsquo; is not to come up with some nifty new theory of
morality, but rather to provide a faithful descriptive and
interpretive rendering of the moral rules, ideals, and decision
procedures that we all share.  Borrowing a page from Wittgenstein,
Gert declares that his account changes nothing in common morality,
which does not change over time, leaving its central precepts and
decision procedures in place and intact (Gert 2004, p. 4).</p>

<p>

Gert begins his account with the claim that the whole point and
purpose of morality is to lessen the amount of evil or harm suffered
in the world [2004, p. 26], a goal similar to that posited by
Beauchamp and Childress. He then dips into a quasi-Hobbesian account
of human nature, arguing that beings like us&mdash;i.e., vulnerable,
mortal, rational, and fallible (p. 8)&mdash;would favor adopting
common morality as a public system that impartially applied to
everyone. The content of common morality consists of moral rules and
moral ideals. Given the point of morality, all ten of the rules (a
Decalogue!) proscribe actions that either directly cause harm, (e.g.,
killing, lying, causing pain, disabling, depriving of freedom or
pleasure) or tend to produce harmful results (e.g., do not deceive,
break promises, cheat, disobey the law, or fail to do your
duty). Whereas the moral rules categorically prohibit violations
(unless sufficient reasons can be provided), the moral ideals
merely encourage people to prevent or relieve the sorts of harms
covered by the rules.</p>

<p>

In what sense are the common morality approaches of
Beauchamp-Childress and Gert moral <em>theories</em>? While the former
have not abandoned their belief that their principles of biomedical
ethics could be derived from disparate but converging high level
theories (2009, 361-63), they now stress the origin of their principles
in ordinary, universally shared moral beliefs rather than in some
special moral sensibility, pure reason, rationality, natural rights, or
some grand normative ethical theory. Echoing Rawls's comment on
the pivotal role of so-called &ldquo;considered moral judgments,&rdquo;
Beauchamp and Childress now consider any conflicts between common
morality and moral theory to tell against the credibility of
the
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>
Taking this common morality as a given of human history and experience,
Beauchamp-Childress are prepared to defend its principles on pragmatic
grounds and to deploy those same principles in concrete moral and
policy analyses through a process of increasing specification and
balancing. Although they thus distance themselves from theory as a
source of ultimate justification for their working principles, they
still refer to their position as a &ldquo;common morality theory&rdquo;
in order to distinguish it from other fundamental approaches to
bioethics.</p>

<p>

As for Gert, he too regards the repository of common morality to be
a given of sorts. All people committed to the spirit of morality will,
he asserts, agree on the basic rules and ideals embedded in common
morality. And like Beauchamp and Childress, Gert does not found the
tenets of common morality upon any of the usual moral theories, about
which he tends to be fairly dismissive. On the other hand, Gert regards
the elaboration, interpretation, and systematic defense of the common
morality to be his own contribution to philosophical theory.</p>

<h4>2.7 Normative theories of limited scope</h4>

<p> Another more modest version of normative theory (compared to high
theory) includes theories of relatively narrow scope and ambition,
focused upon particular problems or recurring themes. In contrast to
common conceptions of high theory, which envision it as perched on a
shelf, more or less already fully articulated and awaiting any and all
applications to particular moral problems, some normative theories
grow out of particular struggles with particular moral problems and
thus have a more limited scope than more paradigmatic normative
theories, such as utilitarianism or deontology. In attempting to
characterize his own very creative approach to the linked problems of
abortion and euthanasia, Ronald Dworkin (a frequent contributor to the
bioethical literature, even if not a bioethicist <em>malgr&eacute;
lui</em>) refers to his own approach alternatively as a theory
developed from the inside of these moral problems, as a theory
&ldquo;made for the occasion&rdquo; rather than prefabricated, a
theory, in short, tailored on Saville Row rather than mass produced on
Seventh Avenue. Thus, instead of invoking various familiar moral
theories bearing on liberty and autonomy, Dworkin develops a theory of
value focused upon clashing views of the &ldquo;sacredness&rdquo; of
human life as manifested in debates over abortion and euthanasia
(Dworkin 1993). As we saw in the main body of this entry (Sec. 6), a
wide variety of mid-level theories of limited scope constitute perhaps
the greatest theoretical contribution of philosophy to bioethics.</p>


<h3>3. Metaethical theory</h3>

<p>

Although most theorizing in bioethics falls squarely under the
heading of normative ethical theory&mdash;i.e., substantive accounts
of what is good, virtuous, obligatory, etc.&mdash;theoretical issues
of another kind, i.e., so-called &ldquo;metaethical&rdquo; concerns,
often lurk in the background. These deeper, more fundamental questions
have traditionally encompassed controversies surrounding the very point
and purpose of ethics, the meanings of ethical terms (e.g.,
&ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;good&rdquo;), what it means to hold an
ethical view (i.e., do ethical judgments merely express subjective
preferences?), the objectivity of moral judgments and the possibility
of ethical truth, and how we might best justify our moral
judgments.</p>

<p>

Although most working stiff practical ethicists manage to get through
their careers without bothering too much about the debate between
metaethical internalists and externalists&mdash;i.e., whether there is
an internal, necessary connection between one's moral beliefs about
doing X and one's corresponding motivations regarding the doing of
X&mdash;some distinctly metaethical questions are harder to avoid,
even within a practical field like bioethics. For example, one very
fundamental and much discussed question in bioethics has to do with
the sources and limits of moral justification. According to one
influential view, our actions or policies are morally justified
insofar as they are validated by some moral principle or other, but
rival metaethical views contend, for example, that moral justification
is achieved, not by appealing to principles alone, but rather by
appeal to various paradigm cases, as in casuistry, or to the
harmonious totality of our intuitions, rules, principles, moral
theories, and background social theories (i.e., reflective
equilibrium). Thus, the entire debate among bioethicists concerning
the respective merits and demerits of various methods of conducting
bioethical inquiry&mdash;including principlism, narrative, casuistry,
and reflective equilibrium&mdash;is itself an unavoidable metaethical
question. Indeed, the entire present essay is itself an extended
metaethical exercise.</p>

<p>

Another important metaethical issue concerns the very possibility of
ethical truth, objectivity, or justification within the sphere of
secular bioethics. H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. has argued forcefully,
if not entirely convincingly, that there is quite simply no canonical
articulation or ordering of values in the secular, public square, and
thus that there can be no foundational public bioethics based upon
content-full conceptions of things like dignity, equality, or liberty
(1996). Because we cannot agree on such fundamental matters in our
so-called &ldquo;post-Christian,&rdquo; &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; age,
contends Engelhardt, most of contemporary bioethics, and especially
those views that aspire to articulate and justify our &ldquo;common
morality,&rdquo; are essentially fraudulent. Worse yet, he claims, the
state or medical profession cannot act upon the edicts of contemporary
bioethics without violating the autonomy or dignity of all those
(usually flinty, contrarian, well off Texans) who happen to disagree
with today's <em>bien pensant</em> bioethicists. Were it
convincing, Engelhardt's metaethical theory thus would have
important normative theoretical consequences&mdash;for example, we
would all have to be libertarians &ldquo;by default.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>4. Metaphysical theories</h3>

<p>

For all of its emphasis on down-to-earth practice, bioethics harbors
a number of explicitly metaphysical controversies that ultimately play
important roles in normative argument. Unsurprisingly, many of these
controversies arise on the borderlands between life and death. The
problem of abortion poses the question, &ldquo;When, exactly, does a
full-fledged human being or &lsquo;person&rsquo; with the full panoply
of human rights come into being?&rdquo; At the other end of
life's journey, we ask, &ldquo;When, exactly, does a person
die?&rdquo;, and in order to address this question, we need to proffer
a definition of death itself. Is death best defined in terms of the
human organism or rather in terms of the person's ability to
reason or her embodied brain? Although some might prefer to finesse
such difficult questions by appealing straightaway to more tractable
normative arguments bearing, respectively, on harms to women stemming
from illegal abortions or the diminished value of life in a persistent
vegetative state, a satisfactory account of such issues will require an
explicitly metaphysical examination of the nature of being human and of
personal identity (DeGrazia 2005, McMahan 2003).</p>

<p>

Bioethics is thus fraught with important metaphysical debates that
simply cannot be finessed by appeals to common sense or institutional
practices. In addition to the well-worn metaphysical debates over moral
status and personhood, so prevalent in the literature on abortion and
brain death, the theme of personal identity plays an important role
across a number of fronts in bioethics, including debates over advance
directives and reproductive ethics. One particularly interesting and
important contribution involves the deployment of Derek Parfit's
so-called &ldquo;non-identity problem&rdquo; in the context of
reproductive ethics (Parfit 1986). Critics of various reproductive
technologies (such as cloning, surrogate parenting, and in vitro
fertilization) often claim that such controversial techniques can
result in harms to the children conceived with their assistance and,
thus, should either be banned or highly regulated. Such harms might
include various birth defects, the sequelae of premature birth, social
stigma, or the psychological damage associated with being a clone or an
object of commercial transaction between contracting parents and
surrogates (President's Council 2002). As Parfit has shown, such
allegations often assume a standard account of harm according to which
an action adversely affects the welfare of a single, enduring,
identifiable person&mdash;for example, a mother's heavy
drinking might engender severe neurological deficits in her developing
fetus, which would otherwise have enjoyed normal health.</p>

<p>

But what are we to make of reproductive choices that will determine
the very identities of the children they usher into existence? For such
children (e.g., those born as a direct result of standard surrogacy
arrangements or IVF) the choice isn't between a future threatened
by possible psychological or physical harms and another perfectly
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; future without such harms; rather, assuming
<em>arguendo</em> that there are psychological and somatic risks
involved in these new reproductive technologies, the choice regarding
the child is either for a life with a risk of some harm versus no life
at all. A decision on the part of worried parents to opt for standard
coital reproduction rather than surrogacy or IVF would bring a
<em>different</em> <em>child</em>, with a different identity, into
being. Thus, if Parfit is correct, we cannot say that a child
suffering from psychological or physical burdens resulting from her
high tech conception has been harmed by being brought into
existence. We might still want to say that the parents of such a child
acted irresponsibly, assuming the controversial premise that the risks
of harm were indeed high, but we cannot do so on the ground that the
reproductive arrangement harmed the child, who owed her very existence
to it.  Although the alternative account we give of such parental
irresponsibility will no doubt depend upon a normative moral
theory&mdash;e.g., the parents have brought an excessive amount of
needless suffering into the world (Brock 1995)&mdash;the need for an
alternative explanation is demonstrated by Parfit's expressly
metaphysical argument.</p>

<p>

To summarize the main results of this brief typology: (1) The field
of bioethics is saturated with theories of different sorts (normative,
metaethical, and metaphysical) that exhibit different levels of
generality and comprehensiveness. (2) Invocations of theory in
bioethics will be more or less appropriate depending upon the
particular level of bioethical practice in play&mdash;for example,
whether one is engaging in a clinical consult, advising a hospital
committee or public ethics commission on policy, or teaching an
undergraduate course or graduate seminar.</p>
