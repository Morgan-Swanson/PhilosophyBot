<h2>Descartes' 1616 Law Thesis &ndash; English Translation</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>

TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MAN</p>

<p>

LORD D. RENE BROCHARD,</p>

<p>

LORD OF DES FONTAINES, ETC.</p>

<p>

MOST VIRTUOUS SENATOR IN THE GUBANATORIAL HOUSE OF POITIERS,</p>

<p>

[AND] HIS OWN ESPECIALLY ESTEEMED UNCLE.</p>

<p>

Ren&eacute; Descartes I.V.Q. License, S.P.D.</p>

<p>

<em>I delight to come to pure well-springs, and to drink them in; I
delight to pluck new flowers.</em> [Lucretius, <em>On the Nature of
Things</em>, Book 4, ll. 2-3]</p>
</div>

<p>

Indeed, when I flee to you, uncle, you whom I should most esteem, it
seems as if I have come to the agreeable well-spring of integrity
itself, where, not only will I be adorned with the most fragrant
flowers of your fame, <em>so that I myself do nothing of future
glory</em> [variant of Juvenal, <em>Satires</em>, Book VIII, l. 75],
but I also do not despair that if my youth itself, unripe until now and
green, is irrigated by the most sweet well-springs of your virtue, it
can at length bloom. For as with the tender meadows, the more they are
moistened with fruitful waters, the more they are covered with the
ornamental beauty of flowers, so surely human talents, the more they
drink the sweet draughts of knowledge and virtue, the more they
flourish.</p>

<p>

Because when, a short time ago, with a peculiar felicity I began
learning, almost from the tender conclusion of a squalling young age
until now, I attached my little lips to the delicious well-springs of
the liberal arts with the foster-mother&rsquo;s moist milky dew. And
indeed gently at first, exceedingly delighted by the pleasing murmur of
a roaring wave, I eagerly desired to drink in the poetical waters,
dripping with honey. Soon, struck with wonder at a deeper rumbling and
rushing sounds like a torrent, I thirsted with great longing for the
wider rivers of eloquence. But in truth, not satisfied with these,
which of course excite a thirst for knowing without in any way
assuaging it, I searched finally with keen application for that most
immense ocean of the sciences and from that ocean all the streams
flowing most abundantly in different directions. Indeed [I was] not so
carried away by vainglorious folly that I, not thinking about the
chains of my poverty, supposed that I could drink up even the single
streamlet of any discipline, but when I was to have chosen some stream
before the rest, by whose sweetest dew the thirst of my natural talents
would be assuaged for the future, I longed to discern everything by
experience.</p>

<p>

Nor did the laborious desire for knowledge weary me, until at last I
perceived that the very pure well-springs of virtue and learning flow
from you, so that thereafter I began to loathe the rest and only to
value and pursue what is yours. That is to say (lest my discourse
perhaps gets a bit murky), I set you forth as the one thing out of all
that I should admire and imitate. For so great is the purity of your
life, so great the integrity of your customs, the sweetness of your
conversation, the richness of your teaching, the brightness of your
virtue, that nothing more could be desired to complete that most
pleasant well-spring. For what else is there? Or rather so that it may
roar gently &mdash; <em>does the swift river quiver because of a
meandering brook?</em> [Horace, <em>Odes</em>, Book II, Part 3, ll.
11-12] Yes, when it is compelled to allow those well-springs of your
virtue, flowing around with the most agreeable buzzing of public
opinion, and the meandering judgments of the envious. And yet not that
especially, nor the purity of its silver fruitful water, nor the golden
splendor of its rich sand, has so much allured me to it. But a most
beautiful nymph appeared here to me, not Artemis, such as the
unfortunate Actaeon once saw, but Themis, who changed me also, but for
an utterly dissimilar reason; indeed she did not bury me in a stag, so
that once and for the future I would, with frightening speed, avoid the
presence of the one gazed at, but she tamed the wildness from [my]
former inborn freedom into a slave, so that I would pursue her
constantly with burning desire all of my life. Since indeed now
especially I greatly wish that I be proved not unworthy to be her lover
and worshipper, it has pleased you, doubtless not undeservedly, you who
reside in your pure well-springs as if in their own shrine, to
assemble, so that you may deign to unite to me the favor and
benevolence of so lovable a goddess.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

Theses according to both sides of the law concerning
the settling of last wills</p>

<ol>
<li>A last will can generally be defined as the final clause of a will,
according to which an inheritance is granted.</li>

<li>Its most important division, not fully observed everywhere, is in
that which is of the civil law and that which is of the law of the
nations.</li>

<li>For the latter [the law of the nations] receives powers from
someone's private ordering;</li>

<li>The former [civil law] from public authority.</li>

<li>The latter is executed by an adequate declaration alone;</li>

<li>The former by observation, of all kinds, of the law.</li>

<li>Finally the latter everyone, who has anything to dispose of, can
make;</li>

<li>The former indeed those only to whom the law or the prince will
have allowed.</li>

<li>We distinguish these therefore because the last will of the law of
the nations is valid by pontifical law.</li>

<li>Nor is any custom considered in that, but only natural
justice.</li>

<li>However, that of civil law is righty defined by Modestinus by a
just determination of our will concerning that which someone wishes to
happen after his death.</li>

<li>Those under age do not have the power to do this.</li>

<li>Nor the servants of a son, not even concerning merely unusual
goods, with the exception of the castrated, or those who are like the
castrated.</li>

<li>Nor those wavering concerning their own estate, or those in
error.</li>

<li>Nor the insane, or those in a passionate rage.</li>

<li>Nor the prodigal, the management of whose goods is prohibited.</li>

<li>Nor those condemned by capital judgment, unless an appeal is
pending.</li>

<li>Nor anyone who is a servant.</li>

<li>Nor finally anyone whom the law has judged to be dishonest and
incapable, by reason of misconduct, of making a will.</li>

<li>Such are heretics, and those who promote them, if they disdain to
make amends within a year from the time when they are
excommunicated.</li>

<li>Moreover, this last will, which is of civil law, is made either by
common law or singular law.</li>

<li>That made by common law is either pronounced publicly or in
writing.</li>

<li>Which division arises from a different custom in each case.</li>

<li>To be sure, that all the witnesses hear it publicly pertains to the
custom of the former one.</li>

<li>And therefore in those words understanding is altogether
required.</li>

<li>For the custom of the latter, that they sign at the same time and
seal it with a seal-ring.</li>

<li>Likewise as to written documents, that they were not written in
marks.</li>

<li>And indeed for both, that seven suitable witnesses are
summoned.</li>

<li>Who are questioned for the sake of this matter.</li>

<li>And the unwilling would not continue all the way to the end.</li>

<li>And in one continuous time the entire last will is completed.</li>

<li>Moreover, a legatee also, for a will declared orally [not in
writing], is a suitable witness.</li>

<li>An heir in neither of the two.</li>

<li>Whence it appears here that seven witnesses are required, not for
simple proof, but most of all because of custom.</li>

<li>These to be sure although after the completed testament, or
immediately [missing text] cease to offer testimony.</li>

<li>Or also [missing text] the suitable witnesses were not there at the
making of the testament, yet the law does not fail in that
[situation].</li>

<li>But if it can be proven sufficiently anyplace, just as [missing
text].</li>

<li>By singular law a last will is made in which custom [missing text]
of a soldier, or countryman, or added over and above [missing
text].</li>

<li>Also at the time of a contagion, the witnesses [missing text] is
relaxed: of the rest moreover [missing text].</li>

<li>That finally which avails only [missing text] last will.</li>
</ol>

Holly Johnson (Mississippi State
University) and I translated the above from the Latin text. Holly gets credit for finding all of the passages cited by Descartes. We deliberately kept the flowery language and complex sentence structure in order to preserve Descartes' style of writing as a young man. We
thank Joan Sampey for help with a few tricky passages. We are indebted
to Daniel Garber for providing a copy of the original Latin Law Thesis,
and to Jean-Robert Armogathe, Vincent Carraud, Robert Feenstra, who in
their 1988 <em>Nouvelles De La Republique Des Lettres</em> article
provide a clean Latin transcription&mdash;the original document being
difficult to read in places.</p>
