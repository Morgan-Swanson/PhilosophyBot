<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Antoine Arnauld</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>.
 Phillipe Sellier has said that this translation is &ldquo;a literary
and religious monument not unworthy of comparison with Luther's Bible
in Germany and the King James version in England&rdquo; (<em>La
Bible,</em> ed. Philippe Sellier, p. xi).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>.
 He adds an important qualification: &ldquo;I say,
<em>principally,</em> because nothing prevents one from using
authorities in philosophical questions as well, if they are used for
illustration rather than to decide the questions&rdquo; (<em>OA,</em>
40:153).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>.
 Letter to Pellison, A/1/7/196, cited by R. C. Sleigh, Jr. in
<em>Leibniz and Arnauld, a Commentary on Their Correspondence</em>,
Yale University Press, 1990, p. 31.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>.
 Arnauld's use of &ldquo;to represent&rdquo; as a three-place
relational verb (&ldquo;<em>X</em> represents <em>Y</em> to
<em>Z</em>&rdquo;) meaning &ldquo;to make known to&rdquo; is
consistent with Descartes' usage. It is often overlooked that
Descartes used the two Latin verbs,
&ldquo;<em>r&eacute;presentare</em> (to represent)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>exhibere</em> (to exhibit or to show)&rdquo;
interchangeably. A good example is the thirteenth paragraph of the
Third Meditation. Here is a literal translation of the Latin:
&ldquo;To be sure, in so far as those ideas are only certain modes of
thinking, I do not recognize any inequality among them and they all
seem to proceed from me in the same way; but, in so far as one
<em>represents (representat)</em> one thing, and another another, it
seems that they are quite different from one another. For without
doubt those that <em>exhibit (exhibent)</em> substance to me are
something greater, and, so to speak, contain in themselves more
objective reality, than those which <em>represent
(r&eacute;presentant)</em> only modes, or accidents, and on the other
hand that [idea] through which I understand a supreme God, eternal,
infinite, omniscient, omnipotent, and creator of all things outside of
himself, has more objective reality in itself, than those through
which finite substances are <em>exhibited</em>
(<em>exhibenter</em>).&rdquo; The two occurrences of
&ldquo;<em>exhibere</em>&rdquo;, as well as the two occurrences of
&ldquo;<em>r&eacute;presentare</em>&rdquo; are translated by the
French &ldquo;<em>representer</em>&rdquo; in the 1647 translation of
the <em>Meditations</em> by the Duc de Luynes, and by the English
&ldquo;represent&rdquo; in the English translation by Cottingham, et
al.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>.
 Forming this general rule from the certainty that one is thinking and
alive is an example of the method of analysis, in which one arises to
&ldquo;general notions&rdquo; from &ldquo;the particular examination
of the thing we are investigating&rdquo; (<em>Logic</em>, p. 237).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>.
 Regarding the proposition, &ldquo;Everything contained in the clear
and distinct idea of a thing can be truthfully affirmed of that
thing,&rdquo; the Port Royal <em>Logic</em> says, &ldquo;This
principle cannot be contested without destroying everything evident in
human knowledge and establishing a ridiculous Pyrrhonism&rdquo; (p.
247). But if this principle cannot or ought not be doubted, then the
most famous problem Arnauld raised in the &ldquo;Fourth
Objections,&rdquo; namely, &ldquo;how the author avoids reasoning in a
circle when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and
distinctly perceive is true only because God exists&rdquo; (Descartes,
II, 150), does not arise within Arnauld's philosophy, and it is not
clear whether he thought Descartes' attempted solution to the problem
was successful.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>.
 In his first letter to Descartes in 1648, Arnauld says, &ldquo;What
you have taught about the distinction of the mind from the body seems
to me quite clear, perspicuous and divine&rdquo; (OA, 38:68). It is
well known that, in the &ldquo;Fourth Objections&rdquo; Arnauld had
raised objections to Descartes' argument for the real distinction, but
evidently he was satisfied with Descartes' reply.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>.
 <em>Examen d'un Ecrit qui a pour titre: Trait&eacute; de l'essence du
corps, et ce l'union de l'ame avec le corps contra la philosophie de
M. Descartes</em>, (<em>OA</em> 38:89&ndash;176). There is no known
extant copy of Le Moine's treatise, but it is quoted fairly
extensively by Arnauld. Hereinafter I will refer to this work by
Arnauld simply as &ldquo;<em>Examen.&rdquo;</em> An improved edition
of the work has been published: <em>Texte revu par Emmanuel Faye</em>,
Librarie Arth&egrave;me Fayard, 1999.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>.
 In Part Two of <em>Examen</em> (<em>OA</em>, 38:100 ff.) Arnauld
takes up the delicate question of whether Descartes' position on the
essence of matter is consistent with the Catholic doctrine of
transubstantiation. He begins by saying, &ldquo;In order that the
state of the question be better understood, I thought that I ought to
report a place in the <em>Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;</em>,
Book 3, Part 2, Ch. 8, N. 2, because it will show both what led to the
definition of matter as extension and our disposition regarding the
mysteries that it seems cannot be reconciled with that
definition.&rdquo; He then quotes five pages from the
<em>Recherche</em> which give an account of the essence of matter
which Arnauld knew perfectly well was not the same as the account
given by Descartes. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>.
 The state of the question is nicely summarized by Denis Moreau in
&ldquo;La 'Philosophie d'Antoine Arnauld': Un Bilan,&rdquo; in
<em>Chroniques de Port-Royal</em>,2011. See also Emmanuel Faye's
article in <em>Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>.On
 relations between Arnauld and Malebranche prior to the publication of
Malebranche's <em>Treatise of Nature and Grace</em>, see
<em>Correspondance et actes (1638&ndash;1689)</em>, recueillis et
pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s par Andr&eacute; Robinet, vol. 18 of
<em>OM</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a>.
 For a detailed chronology of the controversy, see Moreau, 1999, p.
25&ndash;28.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>.
 <em>OM</em>, 8:723&ndash;34. Malebranche cites the classic text, 1
Timothy, 2,4, for the doctrine that God wants all men to be saved.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>.
 &ldquo;By a practical will, I mean a decree or will executing a
settled plan&rdquo; (<em>OM</em>, 5:180).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a>.
 There is an ambiguity in Malebranche's use of the phrase
&ldquo;occasional cause.&rdquo; Sometimes he uses it to refer to a
<em>thing</em> on the occasion of whose action God causes another
event to occur, and sometimes he uses it to refer to an <em>event</em>
on the occasion of whose occurrence God causes another event to
occur.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a>.
 The importance of this theme in Arnauld's criticism of Malebranche
was brought home to me by a recent email exchange with Steven Nadler.
For Nadler's interpretation, see his article, &ldquo;Arnauld's
God,&rdquo; forthcoming.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a>.
 The very title of Arnauld's work, <em>Reflexions philosophiques et
th&eacute;ologiques sur le nouveau syst&egrave;me de la Nature et de
la Grace</em>, contains the suggestion that Malebranche failed to
follow a rule he himself took over from Augustine: &ldquo;In
theological matters, novelty has the character of error, and one ought
to look down upon opinions for the simple reason that they are new and
without foundation in tradition&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>, 39:171).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a>.
 For a different approach to the connection between &ldquo;the
philosophical debate over ideas and the broader, and (to Arnauld) more
important, theological debate,&rdquo; see Nadler, 1989, pp.
179&ndash;84.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a>.
 Steven Nadler seems to disagrees on this point. Nadler says,
&ldquo;Everything points to Arnauld's God being an ultimately
arbitrary deity who does not act for any reason at all--indeed, a
deity who, in His being, transcends practical rationality
altogether&rdquo; [Nadler, 2008, p. 533].</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>.
 The phrase, &ldquo;God can act externally only in order to procure an
honor worthy of Himself&rdquo; is Arnauld's paraphrase of #11 of the
<em>Troisi&egrave;me Eclaircissement</em>, in which Malebranche's
words are &ldquo; God can act only for Himself. If He wills to act, it
is because He wills to procure an honor worthy of Himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a>.
 Arnauld cites <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I, 19, a. 2.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a>.
 On this point, see Sleigh 1990, p. 43&ndash;47.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a>.
 For support of Arnauld's interpretation, see Kremer 2000. Malebranche
himself, in his last published work, says explicitly that the human
soul is the &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;real&rdquo; cause of its own
free consent to &ldquo;the motives that solicit the soul,&rdquo; thus
allowing an exception to his general principle that God is the only
true efficient cause (<em>R&eacute;flexions sur la Pr&eacute;motion
physique</em>, <em>OM,</em> 16:42&ndash;43).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a>.
 Arnauld is referring to St. Thomas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I, 19,
6, ad 1. Aquinas' Latin is &ldquo;Magis potest dici velleitas, quam
absoluta voluntas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a>.
 In the seventh of <em>Neuf lettres de M. Arnauld contre R. P.
Malebranche</em>, published just before the first two books of
<em>R&eacute;flexions</em>, Arnauld directly attacks Malebranche's
account of <em>grace efficace par elle-m&ecirc;me.</em> He says that
Malebranche's position combines a truth of the Catholic faith with two
errors, one of Luther, the other of Pelagius. The Catholic truth is
that &ldquo;God, through His grace, efficaciously forms in us a
movement of love, which carries us toward Him and toward what we know
is agreeable to Him, for that is the definition that St. Augustine
gives of the grace of Jesus Christ, <em>Inspiratio dilectionis, ut
cognita sancta amore faciamus</em>.&rdquo; But Malebranche holds that
this movement is neither free nor meritorious. Thus he falls into the
error of Luther, who said that the love of God formed in us by grace
is neither free nor meritorious. On the other hand, Malebranche holds
that a person's free consent, the necessary ingredient, so to speak,
which converts the grace of feeling into a free and meritorious love
of God, is not produced by grace. In that way, he falls into the error
of Pelagius, who said that since the actions of Christian piety are
free and meritorious, they are not formed in us by grace.</p>

<p>
Arnauld summarizes his analysis of Malebranche's position: &ldquo;The
cause of this monstrous mixture of truth and error is that you have
distinguished what is from God and grace from what is from free will,
as if one and the same movement of love could not be, and indeed is
not, both from God who forms it in us efficaciously by the power of
His grace, by making us will and love (<em>en nous faisant vouloir
&amp; aimer</em>) what He wants [us to will and love], and from free
will, which loves and wills to love, being moved by grace&rdquo;
(<em>OA</em>, 39:113). He goes on to cite St. Thomas, who rejects the
distinction &ldquo;between what is from grace and what is from free
will, as if they could not be the same&rdquo; (Arnauld quotes from
<em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I, 23, a. 5). The views lying behind this
analysis of Arnauld's are discussed in Section VI below.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a>
 The &ldquo;two books&rdquo; mentioned by Arnauld appeared separately
in 1685 as Books One and Two of <em>R&eacute;flexions Philosophiques
et Th&eacute;ologiques sur le nouveau syst&egrave;me de la nature et
de la grace</em>. The entire Third Book was published separately in
1686.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a>.
 For historical details, see the article, &ldquo;Molinism,&rdquo; by
E. Vansteenberghe, in the <em>Dictionnaire de Th&eacute;ologie
Catholique</em>. The best source in English is the translation of
Molina's <em>On Divine Foreknowledge</em>, with a lengthy introduction
and many notes by Alfred J. Freddoso . The <em>Congregationes de
Auxiliis</em> were the most prolonged and famous of several disputes
at the time about predestination, grace, and free will. Also important
were the censure of seventy-nine propositions of Baius (Michel du Bay)
in 1567 and 1579, and the censure of thirty-one propositions from the
work of the Jesuit Lessius in 1587.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a>.
 Arnauld and Jansen disagreed with Ba&ntilde;ez about <em>when</em>
actual grace of the will is intrinsically efficacious. Arnauld and
Jansen held that all actual grace of the will that results from the
merits of Christ, by contrast with any such grace received by Adam and
Eve before the Fall, is intrinsically efficacious with respect to what
God proximately intends. Ba&ntilde;ez, on the other hand, said that
actual grace of the will is intrinsically efficacious in all cases in
which its recipients cooperate with it, and in all such cases its
efficacy is part of God's providential plan; otherwise it is
intrinsically inefficacious.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a>.
 Arnauld adds that it would not be prudent to publicize the fact that
he had &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; Jansen on this point.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-30" id="note-30">30.</a>.
 Sleigh suggests that by &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; Arnauld may have
meant to refer specifically to laws of motion (Sleigh, 1996, p. 174).
Sleigh's suggestion is implausible, however, in light of Arnauld's
statement in <em>Examen</em> that God voluntarily undertakes to cause
in our soul perceptions of sensible qualities whenever the
corresponding motions occur in the sensory organs &ldquo;according to
the laws he himself has established in nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-31" id="note-31">31.</a>.
 In this document, Arnauld assembles various passages from St. Thomas
in order to attribute to him the theory of <em>gr&acirc;ce efficace
par elle-m&ecirc;me</em>. Not surprisingly, Arnauld is unable to cite
any passage in which St. Thomas explicitly commits himself to that
theory.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-32" id="note-32">32.</a>.
 Arnauld comments that according to this text, &ldquo;God does not
move all men by grace. For [St. Thomas] explicitly affirms, that not
all and always are men moved by grace, but only
&lsquo;<em>specialiter, &amp; interdum, &amp;
aliquos.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-33" id="note-33">33.</a>.
 See especially letters to Vuillaret (21 juin 1692, OA,
3:497&ndash;98) and to Bossuet (juillet 1694, <em>OA,</em>
3:661&ndash;65). In the letter to Vuillaret, Arnauld says, &ldquo;Only
seven or eight years ago I had the occasion to examine deeply the true
opinion of St. Thomas &hellip; I collected everything he said about
[human freedom] in his <em>Summa</em>, and it was on the basis of this
collection that I wrote the little treatise <em>de
libertate</em>.&rdquo; This would put the composition of the treatise
on freedom in 1684 or 1685, when Arnauld was at the point of
publishing <em>R&eacute;flexions.</em> Arnauld also discusses his new
theory in letters to Du Vaucel (3 ao&ucirc;t 1691, <em>OA,</em>
3:364&ndash;66), to Macaire (26 d&eacute;cembre 1691, <em>OA</em>,
3:417&ndash;20), and to Du Vaucel (9 janvier 1693, <em>OA</em>,
3:581&ndash;83).</p>

A translation of Arnauld's Latin text, made by Pasquier Quesnel, is
contained in <em>OA</em>, 10:614&ndash;624, under the title, <em>De la
Libert&eacute; de l'homme</em>. The original Latin, <em>Humanae
libertatis notio</em>, is published in Volume 6 of <em>Oeuvres
Philosophiques d'Arnauld,</em> edited by Elmar J. Kremer and Denis
Moreau, 2003; and also in <em>Arnauld, Textes philosophiques</em>,
edited by Denis Moreau, 2001.</p>

 In this life here below, one can love God or refrain from doing so,
and hence one freely loves God or not, because one's apprehension of
God is abstract: &ldquo;Because the mind, during this life, knows God
only abstractly &hellip; it can &hellip; attend to some perfections of
God without thinking of others, as when misers, who consider God only
as someone who can make them rich if He wants, can apprehend Him as
their enemy if some extraordinary misfortune befalls them, and for
that reason hate Him or at least not love Him&rdquo;
(<em>Libert&eacute;</em>, <em>OA</em>, 10:618&ndash;19).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-35" id="note-35">35.</a>.
 The the expressions &ldquo;<em>potestas ad opposita&rdquo;</em> and
&ldquo;<em>facultas ad opposita</em>&rdquo; don't seem to be found in
St. Thomas. Certainly neither expression occurs in the texts Arnauld
assembled from the <em>Summa Theologiae</em>. However, the expression,
&ldquo;<em>Voluntas se habet ad opposita in his quae ad finem
ordinatur</em>&rdquo; occurs in I-IIae, 5, 4, ad 2, reproduced (but
mistakenly identified as coming from Part I) in <em>OA 10:629.</em>
Similar expressions occur in I, 19, 2, ad 2, and in I, 62, 8, obj. 2
and ad 2.</p>

 In another late text, he adds that if God did not cause human beings
to will freely, He would not be causing them to act in a meritorious
way: &ldquo;But what Scripture, the Fathers, and reason itself say
about the power of God over the wills of men, assumes that He makes
them will in a manner that is conformed to their nature, which is to
will freely. Otherwise he would not make them accomplish His
commandments or work their salvation, things that can only be done by
free volitions&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>, <em>Instruction</em>, 10:436).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-37" id="note-37">37.</a>.
 Michael Della Rocca has pointed out to me that Arnauld here comes
very close to the position enunciated by Descartes in <em>Principles
of Philosophy</em>, I, 41.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-38" id="note-38">38.</a>.
 Arnauld takes up similar examples in his letters to Mackaire,
Bossuet, adding examples of a highly just judge offered a bribe and an
extremely chaste woman whom someone attempts to seduce.</p>
