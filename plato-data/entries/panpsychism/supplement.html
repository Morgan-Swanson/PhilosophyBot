<h2>Possible Solutions to the Subject-Summing Problem</h2>


<h3>Non-Constitutive Forms of Panpsychism</h3>

<p>
What seems difficult to make sense of in the subject-summing problem
is certain conscious subjects coming together to constitute a new
subject. Constitutive panpsychists need to make sense of this, as they
hold that facts about human and animal subjects are constituted of
facts about more fundamental kind of subject. However, according to
non-constitutive panpsychism human and animal subjects are
fundamental, and hence there is no obvious need to make sense of a
constitution relation holding between distinct subjects. Thus, it is
much less obvious that non-constitutive panpsychists are threatened by
the subject-summing problem.</p>

<p>
There may nonetheless be some troubles (for the non-constitutive
panpsychist) pertaining to subject combination, depending on the
details of the view. The emergentist panpsychist who is happy to
explain the emergence of biological subjects from micro-level subjects
in terms of brute contingent laws of nature will thereby avoid the
pressure to make sense of an intelligible connection between the
emergent biological mind and that from which it
 emerges.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s1" id="ref-s1">1</a>]</sup>
 However, an emergentist panpsychist who thinks that causation is an
intelligible process will need to make sense of the intelligible
emergence of biological subjects, something that is threatened by
Goff&rsquo;s conceivability argument against mental combination
(considered in the discussion of the subject-summing problem). Patrick
Lewtas (forthcoming) has developed an elaborate form of layered
emergentism in which there are no intelligibility gaps. Hedda Hassel
M&oslash;rch (2014) has developed a form of fusionism according to
which the emergence of biological subjects from micro-subjects is
partially intelligible.</p>

<p>
Even if resistant to the subject-summing problem, non-constitutive
forms of panpsychism may suffer from other forms of the combination
problem, some of which are discussed in the main body of this
entry.</p>

<h3>The Ignorance Response</h3>

<p>
Galen Strawson (2006b: section 16) responds to the subject-summing problem by suggesting
that there could be some aspect of the nature of consciousness we
don&rsquo;t have a grip on, but which is essential for understanding
subject combination. This response might be spelt out in two ways. It
could be that there is something about the property of consciousness
itself we don&rsquo;t understand. Alternately (Goff 2017), it could be
that consciousness is part of a more expansive property,
&ldquo;consciousness+&rdquo;, of which consciousness is one aspect.
(It is pleasant to reflect on how beautiful such a property would be,
enfolding experiential and non-experiential aspects into a single
unified nature).</p>

<p>
It could be held that this ignorance is temporary; theorising our way
to this hidden factor could be seen as a crucial goal for future
enquiry. Or it could be that humans are just constitutively incapable
of ever coming to an understanding of the missing facts, just as dogs
do not have the kind of brains that would allow them to do
mathematics. This latter form of the ignorance response can be seen as
a kind of hybrid of panpsychism and mysterianism (discussed in the
<em>Panpsychism Versus Panprotopsychism</em> section).</p>

<p>
One difficulty with this response (Goff 2009, 2017: ch. 7) is it threatens to
undermine at least one motivation for panpsychism. If we need to
invest in hidden properties in order to explain macro-level
consciousness, why not suppose that those hidden properties do all the
work? After all, <em>ex hypothesi</em> we don&rsquo;t really
understand how the hidden properties contribute to grounding
consciousness, and this ignorance would seem to remove any grounds for
thinking that the hidden properties are only able to ground
macro-level consciousness by combining with micro-level consciousness.
Thus, we arguably lose our motivation for postulating
micro-consciousness. If we need to postulate hidden properties anyway,
and they could do all the work, why
 bother?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s2" id="ref-s2">2</a>]</sup>
 It is important to note that this does not remove other motivations
for panpsychism, such as the intrinsic nature argument (discussed in
the main body of this entry).</p>

<h3>Phenomenal Bonding</h3>

<p>
In virtue of what do certain entities compose another entity? It is
natural to think that relations have at least something to do with it.
Bricks can&rsquo;t compose a house unless they are stuck together;
organs can&rsquo;t compose a body unless they work together in
sustaining the organism. Thus, one might suppose that there is some
special relationship that obtains between certain micro-level
conscious subjects, in virtue of which they constitute a macro-level
conscious subject. Goff (2009, 2016) dubbed such a relationship
&ldquo;phenomenal bonding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Turning this into an adequate response to the subject-summing problem
would seem to require cashing out the exact nature of this
relationship. Conceiving of micro-level conscious subjects standing in
physical relationships to each other, e.g., spatial or functional
relationships, does not seem to close the conceivability gap between
subjects at the micro-level and subjects at the macro-level; this is
evidenced by the apparent conceivability of micro-experiential zombies
(see Goff&rsquo;s conceivability argument against mental combination,
considered in the discussion of the subject-summing problem). What
other relations are there that micro-subjects bear to each other?</p>

<p>
One option is to hold that we have no positive conception of the
phenomenal bonding relation, and that this accounts for our inability
to understand phenomenal bonding. This would make the phenomenal
bonding solution a form of the ignorance response outlined above;
it&rsquo;s just that what we are ignorant of is not some aspect of
consciousness itself, but a relationship which conscious subjects bear
to each other. This may raise lead to a worry similar to that outlined
in the last section: if we have no positive grip on the nature of the
relationship that bonds things together to produce macro-level
subjects, why not suppose that that relationship bonds together
non-conscious things (to make a conscious thing) rather than conscious
things (to make a conscious thing)? This would dispense with the need
to postulate micro-level consciousness. On the other hand (Goff 2016,
2017: ch. 7), if our aim is to characterise the intrinsic nature of matter
(see the discussion of the intrinsic nature argument), then this view
is arguably superior to out and out mysterianism, in that it does at
least provide us with a positive conception of the non-relational
properties of material entities. </p>

<p>
Barry Dainton (2011) proposes co-consciousness as the phenomenal
bonding relation: the relation that holds between two experiences when
they are <em>experienced together</em>. An advantage of this view,
according to Dainton, is that this is a relation we are aware of in
introspection: when we introspect, it is apparent that each of our
experiences is co-conscious with all of the others. It is perhaps more
natural to suppose that this fact is grounded in the fact that each of
my experiences belongs to the same subject. But it is not obviously
incoherent to suppose that the priority goes the other way round: my
experiences belong to a single unified subject because they are
co-conscious with each other. Perhaps then micro-level experiences
compose a macro-level subject when they come to bear the
co-consciousness relation to each other.</p>

<h3>Cosmopsychism</h3>

<p>
Constitutive cosmopsychists (discussed in the main body of this entry)
hold that facts about human and animal subjects are grounded in facts
about the conscious universe rather than in facts about micro-level
subjects; thus they avoid the need to make sense of
subject-summing. However, they arguably face an analogous problem,
which Albahari (forthcoming) calls &ldquo;the decombination
problem&rdquo;: in virtue of what do &ldquo;big&rdquo; conscious
subjects (such as the universe) ground &ldquo;little&rdquo; conscious
subjects (such as us)? Just as we can conceive of micro-level subjects
existing in the absence of macro-level subjects, so it seems that we
can conceive of a conscious universe existing without having conscious
parts (i.e., without anything <em>within</em> the universe being
conscious). Thus, if we think of the subject-summing problem as
arising from the conceivability gap between more fundamental and
less-fundamental conscious subjects (see Goff&rsquo;s conceivability
argument against mental combination considered in the discussion of
the subject-summing problem), then constitutive cosmopsychism faces
essentially the same problem.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, cosmopsychists have argued that there are various
respects in which cosmopsychism eases the problem. As discussed in the
main body of this entry, Nagasawa &amp; Wager (2016) suggest that
cosmopsychism can help to address the grain problem. And Goff (2017: ch. 9,
forthcoming) argues that in the framework of constitutive
cosmopsychism there is no need to suppose that less fundamental
properties admit of reductive analysis, and that this removes the
necessity of providing a reductive analysis of human and animal
consciousness. Itay Shani presents his defence of cosmopsychism
against the backdrop of Coleman&rsquo;s version of the subject-summing
problem (discussed in the main document of this entry). Shani concedes
that Coleman demonstrates that the existence of one subject cannot be
wholly grounded in facts about another. Nonetheless, he sketches in
broad brushstrokes an intelligible explanation of each organic
subject&rsquo;s capacity for experience, and its having of a
perspective, in terms of the experiential capacities and the
perspectivality of the universe. Shani hopes that such partial
grounding of non-cosmic subjects allows us to avoid the kind of
radical emergence Strawson worries about in his anti-emergentist
argument (the latter is discussed in the main body of this
 entry).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s3" id="ref-s3">3</a>]</sup></p>
