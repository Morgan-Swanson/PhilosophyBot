<h1>Anthony Collins</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Aug 25, 2003; substantive revision Mon May 20, 2013</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Anthony Collins (1676&ndash;1729) was a wealthy English free-thinker,
deist and materialist who in his later years became a country squire
and local government official in Essex. Along with John Toland,
Collins was the most significant member of a close knit circle of
radical free thinkers that arose in England in the first three decades
of the eighteenth century. This group included such men as Samuel
Bold, Matthew Tindal, Thomas Woolston and William
 Wollaston.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 He was a friend of John Locke in Locke&rsquo;s old age and Locke was
one important formative influence on his philosophical views. In
respect to his materialism and determinism Collins was clearly
influenced more by Hobbes, Bayle and possibly Spinoza than he was by
Locke. The Latitudinarians may well have influenced his views about
free-thinking as well as Locke. Collins&rsquo; works had some
influence in England and much more on the continent during the 18th
century.</p>

<p>
Collins&rsquo; central passion is the autonomy of reason particularly
with respect to religion. Collins was strongly motivated by an
aversion to religious persecution. Issues revolving around religious
freedom are the threads that run through all of his writing. It is
possible to divide Collins&rsquo; works into those that are mainly
philosophical and those that are more narrowly religious, but they are
clearly connected. His 1707&ndash;8 pamphlet controversy with Samuel
Clarke over whether &ldquo;matter can think&rdquo; and other topics,
and his book about free will and determinism are chiefly engaged with
philosophical topics. Even these topics, however, involve such
religious issues as the immortality of the soul and punishment and
reward in the next life. His writing about reason and free-thinking
may be regarded as on the borderline between philosophy and religion.
Although it deals with epistemological and sometimes metaphysical
issues, it focuses almost entirely on religious issues. His religious
works are even more narrowly focused. The Thirty nine Articles are the
only official confessional statement of Anglicanism. Two of
Collins&rsquo; books deal with the authenticity of Article 20 of the
Thirty nine Articles and whether the church has the power to make
doctrine. In large measure these represent the doctrines of
free-thinking applied to the particular case of the Anglican Church.
Collins also wrote a book examining the question of whether the
prophecies of Christ&rsquo;s messiahship could be accepted. This seems
to be a rejection of Christianity as a revealed religion. How far
Collins went in the direction of atheism is still a matter of
scholarly debate.</p>

<p>
Collins was clearly a controversial figure in his time; nor has
scholarly treatment down the years done much better at being
objective. As Ernest Campbell Mossner remarks: &ldquo;The Deists were
long subjected to the <em>odium theologicum</em> and the historians of
the movement have almost without exception downgraded or slandered
them both socially as well as intellectually since the time of John
Leland in the eighteenth century&rdquo; (Mossner 1967b: 335).</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<h3 id="Life">1.1 Life</h3>

<p>
Anthony Collins was born in Heston, Middlesex on June 21, 1676 into a
family of lawyers. He went to Eton and then King&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge in 1693. Though he had not graduated from Cambridge, Collins
went to the Middle Temple in 1694 to study law. He didn&rsquo;t like
the law and was never called to the Bar. In 1698 he married the
daughter of a rich London merchant, Sir Francis Child. She died in
childbirth in 1703. At the time of his marriage he received some
property in Essex from his father. Together with his wife&rsquo;s
dowry, this made him a very rich man indeed. Collins met John Locke on
a visit to Oates in Essex in 1703, visited Locke five times over the
next 18 months and carried on a correspondence with him about various
philosophical topics. In one of his letters to Collins Locke remarked:
&ldquo;Believe it, my good friend, to love truth for truth&rsquo;s
sake is the principal part of human perfection in this world, and the
seed bed of all other virtues; and if I mistake not, you have as much
of it as I have ever met with in anybody.&rdquo; Collins was a
lifelong bibliophile with a large private research library. In the
article on Collins in Birch&rsquo;s Dictionary, Birch notes that his
&ldquo;large and curious [library] was open to all men of letters, to
whom he readily communicated all the lights and assistance in his
power, and even furnished his antagonists with books to confute
himself, and directed them how to give their arguments all the force
of which they were capable&rdquo; (Birch, quoted in Berman 1975).
During this period Collins also met Samuel Bold and John Toland. From
1703 until 1706, after his wife&rsquo;s death, Collins spent the
winters in London and the summers at his fine summer mansion in
Buckinghamshire&mdash;where Queen Anne and her court visited him. In
1707 Collins began a pamphlet controversy with Samuel Clarke, a
prominent British philosopher and member of Newton&rsquo;s inner
circle, over the question of whether matter can think. The controversy
continued until 1708. In 1707 Collins also published anonymously the
<em>Essay Concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions, the evidence
whereof depends on human testimony</em>. During this period Collins
frequented the London coffee shops where the deists and free-thinkers
met. Berkeley apparently met him at such a gathering in 1713. In 1710
Collins made his first trip to the Continent, spending his time buying
books in Holland and meeting John Churchill, first Duke of
Marlborough, and Prince Eugene. Back in England, Collins met several
times with Samuel Clarke and William Whiston at the house of Lady
Calverly and Sir John Hubern for &ldquo;frequent but friendly debates
about the truth of the Bible and the Christian Religion&rdquo;
(Whiston, quoted in O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 77). In 1713 he published
<em>A Discourse Concerning Free-Thinking</em>. The <em>Discourse</em>
was his most controversial work. He made a second trip to the
continent about the time that the <em>Discourse</em> was published.
Again he went to Holland and France and planned to go on to Italy. The
trip was cut short by the death of a close kinsman. In 1715 Collins,
in effect, took root in Essex, moving into Mowdon Hall. Collins
probably owned a good 2000 acres in Essex, much of it prime
agricultural land. In 1717 he published <em>A Philosophical Enquiry
Concerning Human Liberty</em> in which he argues for a compatibilist
form of determinism and rejects freedom of the will. Samuel Clarke
reviewed the book, continuing the argument that had begun during the
Collins-Clarke correspondence of 1707&ndash;08.</p>

<p>
From 1717 on Collins spent most of his time in the country, but still
had a keen interest in national politics at a distance, and local
politics in person. Collins was a Whig and became a spokesman for the
Whigs in the country. Collins took a serious role in the government of
Essex&mdash;serving as a justice, a commissioner for taxes, and then
Treasurer of the County. He examined roads and bridges. He was
involved in finding a place for housing county records. As Treasurer
he was a model of integrity. In considering the relation between
Collins, the County official and Collins the writer, O&rsquo;Higgins
notes that Collins was probably less tolerant towards Catholics than
other justices (1970: 128&ndash;9). And Collins the writer is
consistently anti-Catholic. So, while one might hope that the use of
reason would produce a higher degree of toleration towards all
religious groups than one would expect to find among true believers,
there seems to be little conflict here between the writer and the
jurist.</p>

<p>
In December 1723 Collins&rsquo; only son suddenly became ill and died.
His father was grief-stricken. Collins remarried in 1724 and he
published what is perhaps his most successful book, <em>A Discourse on
the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion</em> as well as
<em>An Historical and Critical Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles of
the Church of England</em>. From 1725 until 1729 Collins&rsquo; health
began to deteriorate. Still, in 1726 he published <em>The Scheme of
Literal Prophecy Considered</em>. In 1729 Collins published <em>A
Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</em>. He was
suffering from gall stones and finally died of his disease on December
13, 1729. His second wife Elisabeth and his two daughters survived
him. He willed his unpublished manuscripts to Pierre Desmaizeaux but
Desmaizeaux took an offer from Collins&rsquo; widow to buy them. It
appears that she then destroyed them. Desmaizeaux quickly regretted
his decision, but it was too late. </p>

<h2 id="CollClarCorr1707">2. The Collins Clarke Correspondence (1707&ndash;08)</h2>

<h3 id="BackConsMateSyst">2.1 Background: Consciousness and Material Systems</h3>

<p>
The chief topic of the Clarke Collins controversy of 1707&ndash;08 is
whether consciousness can inhere in a material system, a highly
controversial issue inspired by Locke&rsquo;s notorious speculation
about thinking matter. In Book IV of <em>An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding</em>, in stressing the limits of human knowledge of
substances, Locke writes: &ldquo;We have the Ideas of Matter and
Thinking, but possibly shall never be able to know, whether any mere
material Being thinks, or no; it being impossible for us, by the
contemplation of our own Ideas, without revelation, to discover
whether Omnipotency has not given to some System of Matter fitly
disposed, a power to perceive and think, or else joined and fixed to
Matter so disposed, a thinking immaterial Substance&hellip;&rdquo;
(1690 IV, iii, 6 [1975: 540&ndash;1]). Locke then went on to
conjecture that it might be just as easy for God to add the power of
thought to a system of matter organized in the right way as for God to
connect an immaterial thinking thing to a body (<em>ibid.</em>).
Clearly, the difficulties in explaining how an immaterial mind could
relate to a material body play a significant role in leading Locke to
this position. This &ldquo;thinking matter&rdquo; passage
&ldquo;raised a storm of protest and discussion that lasted right
through to the last years of the eighteenth century&rdquo; (Yolton
1983: 17). Locke and Collins discussed some of the responses to this
passage that were published before Locke&rsquo;s death in 1704.
Locke&rsquo;s conjecture about thinking matter is, in effect, the
centerpiece of the debate between Samuel Clarke and Anthony Collins
between 1707 and 1708, although the issue was also discussed on the
continent. </p>

<h3 id="Corr">2.2 The Correspondence</h3>

<p>
The correspondence between Clarke and Collins took its inspiration
from a book published in 1706 by Henry Dodwell, putting forward the
view on the basis of various passages from the Bible that without
divine intervention the soul would perish at death. Clarke wrote a
public refutation of Dodwell&rsquo;s book. Besides rejecting
Dodwell&rsquo;s interpretation of scripture, Clarke gave an argument
to show that consciousness could not be a property of a material
system since the most plausible reason, apart from appeals to
scripture, for the soul being naturally mortal is that it is material.
Thus, without mentioning it, Clarke gave a refutation of Locke&rsquo;s
thinking matter hypothesis. Collins, writing to Dodwell concerning
matters about which they disagreed, noted that he would be happy to
see Dodwell have the liberty &ldquo;to publish whatever he thinks
fit&rdquo; (Dybikowski 2011: 188). Collins then wrote a public
&ldquo;Letter to Mr. Dodwell&rdquo; in which he claimed to show that
Clarke&rsquo;s philosophical argument against the mortality of the
soul was inconclusive. Clarke responded with &ldquo;A Defence of a
Letter to Mr. Dodwell.&rdquo; Over the next two years Clarke wrote
three more defenses of his original letter to Henry Dodwell and
Collins wrote three replies. Each of these was longer than its
predecessor. Clarke, who became increasingly irritated as the debate
continued, got the final word in &ldquo;The Fourth Defence of A
Letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
While the central issue of the correspondence is whether it is
possible for consciousness to inhere in a material system and thus for
matter to think, the discussion toward the end turned to other issues
such as free will and determinism and the adequacy of Collins&rsquo;
account of personal identity. Rather than explain the Correspondence
in detail, what follows is a discussion of Collins&rsquo; position in
respect to two central issues, that of emergent properties and
personal
 identity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="ClarCate">2.2.1 Clarke&rsquo;s categories</h4>

<p>
To give a materialist account of life and consciousness, Collins needs
to show that from lifeless and unthinking matter one can get life and
thought. In his &ldquo;Letter to Dodwell&rdquo; Collins claims that
there are material systems all about us whose parts do not have the
properties found in the whole. He gives the example of a rose that has
the power to produce its sweet scent in us, while the particles that
compose it individually do not have this power (Clarke 1738 [1928:
751]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 48&ndash;9). These material systems
provide models and analogies to understand how life and consciousness
can arise from lifeless and thoughtless particles. Thus, from the
beginning, Collins is arguing that consciousness is an emergent
property, i.e. a property had by the whole, but not by the parts that
compose that whole.</p>

<p>
In his First Defence, Clarke responds by giving an argument to show
that there are no real emergent properties. He does this by giving an
enumeration of all of the kinds of properties. It turns out that there
are only three categories. These categories correspond roughly to the
primary, secondary and tertiary qualities of the mechanical philosophy
(Attfield 1977: 46). The correspondence is not precise because Clarke
includes consciousness in the first category, though on a different
basis than first category properties of matter such as magnitude or
motion. Clarke claims that only properties of the first kind are real.
Properties of the second kind are &ldquo;not <em>really Qualities</em>
of the System, and evidently do not in any <em>proper Sense</em>
belong to it, but are only <em>Effects</em> occasionally produced by
it in some other Substance, and truly are Qualities or Modes of that
other Substance in which they are produced&hellip;&rdquo; (Clarke 1738
[1928: 759]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 56). Heat, light, taste and
sound are examples of this class of properties. Clarke claims that
these properties are largely irrelevant to the question about
consciousness because they are modes of the other substance in which
they are produced. The properties of the third kind are fictional.
They &ldquo;are not <em>real Qualities</em> at all, residing in any
subject, but <em>merely abstract Names</em> to express the Effects of
some determinate Motions of certain streams of Matter&hellip;&rdquo;
(Clarke 1738 [1928: 760]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 57). The examples
that Clarke gives of third category properties are magnetism,
electrical attractions and gravity.</p>

<p>
What conditions are required for belonging to Clarke&rsquo;s first
class? In respect to material wholes, Clarke is a reductionist who
holds that whatever real property one finds in the whole must be found
proportionally in the parts. The height of the bricks and the mortar
in a wall sum to the height of the wall as a whole. Thus, all the
properties in a material whole are compositions of the properties of
the parts. Call this Clarke&rsquo;s Composition Principle. Any
property of a material system that fails to conform to this pattern is
not a real property. It follows that emergent properties, properties
possessed by the whole but not by the parts, cannot be real. They
would involve contradictions such as the whole being larger than the
parts, or that something (some property of the whole) comes from
nothing, or that there is something in the effect that is not to be
found in its
 cause.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 As a result of his examination of the kinds of categories, Clarke
claims that all emergent properties belong in his third class, the
class of fictional properties. It follows that since consciousness is
a real property it cannot be an emergent property.</p>

<p>
Since consciousness is a real property it must belong in
Clarke&rsquo;s first class of properties. This being so, it cannot
violate the Composition Principle. But consciousness is so strongly
unified that it cannot be either compounded or divided. This is why it
cannot belong to any material system. So, there must be a second
sufficient condition for belonging to Clarke&rsquo;s first category.
Clarke second sufficient condition is that &ldquo;<em>an Individual
Power</em>, properly and strictly speaking&hellip;can only <em>proceed
from or reside in, an Individual Being</em>&rdquo; (Clarke 1738 [1928:
750]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 58). To be an individual power, Clarke
tells us, a power must be truly unitary, and thus not composed of
parts. Call this the Individual Power Principle. So, consciousness is
an individual power, which belongs to an individual being, the soul.
The soul, too, is so unified that it does not have parts. Magnitude,
in contrast, satisfies the Composition Principle, but is not an
individual power. This is because the matter to which it belongs can
always be divided.</p>

<p>
Collins challenges the enumeration of categories of properties with
which Clarke seeks to prove that consciousness cannot belong to a
material system (Clarke 1738: Vol. 3, p. 751; 767&ndash;70; Clarke and
Collins 2011: 69&ndash;72). He continues to maintain that
consciousness is a real emergent property. He also challenges the
Individual Power Principle.</p>

<h4 id="RealEmerProp">2.2.2 Real emergent properties</h4>

<p>
In responding to Clarke&rsquo;s First Defense, Collins claims that
Clarke has not properly enumerated the kinds of properties. He claims
that Clarke needs to show that his enumeration is complete but has not
done so. There may be powers unknown to Clarke that need to be
included in order to give a complete enumeration of the properties and
powers of matter. In order to effectively defend his materialist
account of consciousness, however, Collins pointed out a new class of
properties that are arguably real and that are emergent and do not fit
Clarke&rsquo;s composition model for real properties of matter.</p>

<p>
Collins&rsquo; chief strategy for showing that there are real emergent
properties is likely derived from Locke&rsquo;s claim in the Chapter
&ldquo;Of Identity and Diversity&rdquo; in the <em>Essay</em> that
living things are individuated not by the matter that composes them at
a time but by their functional organization (Locke 1972: ii. xxvii
3&ndash;4, pp. 330&ndash;331; see also Attfield 1977:
 52)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>.
 Collins begins by considering the different roles that matter and
organization may play in producing all the different kinds of things
in the universe. He starts with the hypothesis that different parts of
matter are different from one another. If this is so the particles of
matter may work in the way different parts of a clock work&mdash;the
parts of the clock are different from one another and consequently
have different powers. The whole to which they contribute will have
powers that none of the parts have (Clarke 1738 [1928: 768]; Clarke
and Collins 2011: 72). The second hypothesis Collins puts forth is
that all matter is the same and therefore completely interchangeable.
Collins prefers this hypothesis because it makes it easy to argue that
all of the differences between the various kinds of things are a
result of their organization. The distinction between matter and its
organization is useful for Collins&rsquo; purposes because the
properties that result from the organization of matter are different
from the properties of the particles. As Collins notes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;if the powers of a System of Matter may intirely cease upon
the least Alteration of a Part of that System, it is evident that the
Powers of the System inhere not in the Parts in the same Sense with
Magnitude and Motion: for divide and vary the Parts of Matter as much
as you will, there will be Magnitude and may be Motion; but divide or
vary the least Part of the Eye, and the Power of contributing to the
Act of Vision is intirely at an end. (Clarke 1738 [1928: 768]; Clarke
and Collins 2011: 72)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The organization of the eye is essential to its proper functioning and
indeed to it being an eye at all (Clarke 1738 [1928: 769]; Clarke and
Collins 2011: 72) It is an emergent property. Collins does not
explicitly make the point that since the organization of the eye is an
essential property it must also be a real property. Perhaps he thought
this obvious. Clarke&rsquo;s response was to claim that the power of
the eye to see is a fictional and not a real property.</p>

<h4 id="PersIden">2.2.3 Personal Identity</h4>

<p>
The topic of personal identity comes up as early as Clarke&rsquo;s
Second Defence of an Argument because Clarke objects to consciousness
being an emergent property of the brain and also objects to the brain
being the bearer or seat of personal identity (Clarke 1738 [1928:
787]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 96). Correspondingly, there are
important connections between Collins&rsquo; account of emergent
properties and his account of personal identity. Consciousness, for
Collins, is both an emergent property and constitutive of personal
identity. In addition, Collins claims that because of the mind body
problem, dualist views do not serve the ends and purposes of religion.
Clarke replies that it is Collins&rsquo; materialist views that have
dangerous consequences for the ends and purposes of religion. Many of
these consequences have to do with personal identity.</p>

<p>
What are the connections between Collins&rsquo; account of emergent
properties and his account of personal identity? The most important
connection is the Lockean distinction between the matter that composes
a material thing at any given time and the organization of matter. The
distinction comes from Locke&rsquo;s account of the individuation of
masses of matter and living things in his chapter &ldquo;Of Identity
and Diversity&rdquo; in Book II of the <em>Essay Concerning Human
Understanding</em>. A mass of matter is individuated by the particles
that compose it, however organized. If the mass gains or loses a
single particle it becomes a different substance. Living things, by
contrast, are individuated by their functional organization (Locke
1972: II. xxvii 3. p. 330). Collins&rsquo; summary of his views on
identity and personal identity make it clear that he agrees completely
with Locke&rsquo;s account of identity and the individuation of
masses, living things and persons (Clarke 1738 [1928: 875]; Clarke and
Collins 2011: 231&ndash;2). But Clarke insists that in order for
something to remain the same, it must remain the same substance. In
the case of material things like oaks, this means that the matter that
composes it must remain the same or it is not the same oak. Only atoms
and persons fulfill this same substance condition for Clarke. So, oaks
are only identical in a fictional sense. In addition, it is not
possible for any entity to have the same properties it had previously
if its substance has changed, because it is not possible to transfer
properties from one substance to another (Clarke 1738 [1928: 798];
Clarke and Collins 2011: 113). So, just as Clarke holds that emergent
properties are fictional, so he holds that any identity not based on
identity of substance is fictional.</p>

<p>
Collins accepts Locke&rsquo;s revolutionary view that consciousness
and not the substantial soul is the bearer of personal identity. Again
agreeing with Locke, he regards both memory as crucial to personal
identity and feelings of pleasure and pain as important concomitants
of consciousness. Still, Collins&rsquo; account of personal identity
is not exactly the same as Locke&rsquo;s. Locke&rsquo;s account is
officially neutral in regard to whether &ldquo;the substance that
thinks in us&rdquo; is material or immaterial, simple or compounded.
Collins, by contrast, is giving an account that makes &ldquo;the
substance that thinks in us&rdquo; material and compounded. But the
neutrality of Locke&rsquo;s account of personal identity ought to
allow Collins to adopt it without significant change, and this is what
he does. Collins also defends the view against attacks addressed to
the concept of memory involved. Clarke holds that Collins&rsquo;
account of memory violates a basic principle of Clarke&rsquo;s
substantialist account of identity&mdash;that properties cannot be
transferred from one substance to another.</p>

<p>
Collins&rsquo; response to this is to claim that annexing
consciousness to the brain explains the phenomenon of consciousness
far better than positing an unchanging immaterial substance. It is
also a perfectly reasonable sense for properties to be transferred
from one substance to another. In his Reflections on Mr.
Clarke&rsquo;s Second Defence he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For if we utterly forget, or cease to be conscious of having done many
things in former Parts of our Lives which we certainly did, as much as
any of those which we are conscious that we have done; and if in fact
we do by degrees forget everything which we do not revive by frequent
Recollection, and by again and again imprinting our decaying Ideas;
and if there be in a determinate Time a partial or total flux of
Particles in our Brains: What can better account for out total
Forgetfulness of some things, our partial Forgetfulness of others,
than to suppose that the Substance of the Brain in constant Flux?
(Clarke 1738 [1928: 809]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 130)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As for the problem of transferring consciousness from one substance to
another he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I will suppose myself conscious at Forty of having been carried to a
Market or Fair at Five Years old, without any Particle of Matter about
me, the same which I had at that Age: now in order to retain the
Consciousness of that Action, it is necessary to revive the Idea of it
before any considerable Flux of Particles, (otherwise I must totally
lose the Memory of it (as I do of several things done in my Childhood)
and by reviving the Idea of that Action, I imprint afresh the
Consciousness of having done that Action, by which the Brain has a
lively and Impression of Consciousness (though it be not entirely
composed of the same Particles) as it had the day after it did the
Action&hellip;. (<em>ibid</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This account of how memory works nicely fits the model of the
preservation of organization through change of matter that Locke uses
to explain the identity of living things. However Clarke does not
accept this explanation because he holds that only a theory of the
substantial soul can provide the underpinnings for an account of
veridical memory.</p>

<h3 id="EvalCollClarCorr">2.3 Evaluating the Collins Clarke Correspondence</h3>

<p>
In evaluating the controversy, one would have to say that of all the
encounters between the Newtonians and the free thinkers, the one
between Collins and Clarke was the most philosophically significant
and influential. O&rsquo;Higgins holds that Collins is important to us
mainly because he defends an early version of materialism. While there
is surely some truth to this, O&rsquo;Higgins is clearly damning
Collins with faint praise. What we should recognize is that Collins
was indeed a pioneer in trying to show that consciousness is a real
emergent property of the brain and in this regard certainly showed
more originality than O&rsquo;Higgins gives him credit for.(See note
2) O&rsquo;Higgins also claims that Collins&rsquo; arguments are not
very good. This also does not give Collins enough credit. It is true
that Collins does give some arguments that are not very good. On the
other hand, Collins forced Clarke to clarify his position in a number
of respects. He also uncovered a number of weak points in
Clarke&rsquo;s position. Clarke&rsquo;s poor treatment of
Collins&rsquo; example of the power of a rose to produce a sweet smell
in us is one example. He answered as if Collins was talking about the
smell of the rose and claims that this secondary quality properly
belongs in his second class of properties. But Collins properly
objects that he was talking about the organization of the particles of
the rose&mdash;the cause of this effect, and not the effect on us.
Clarke&rsquo;s response is weak. One of Collins&rsquo; strongest
points was his critique of Clarke&rsquo;s doctrine that though the
soul is immaterial it is extended (Vailati 1993). One can also see how
much pressure Collins is applying to Clarke&rsquo;s system as the
number of properties in Clarke&rsquo;s third class&mdash;fictional
properties&mdash;continues to mount in the course of the
correspondence. In respect to the central issues of the debate,
Collins is struggling to articulate a materialist and empiricist
metaphysics that can compete with the well developed dualist
metaphysics that Clarke deploys. As Barresi and Martin comment:
&ldquo;His faltering, but often successful attempts to reformulate
traditional metaphysical issues empirically, embodies the birth pangs
of a new approach&rdquo; (Martin and Barresi 2000: 51). But perhaps
most strikingly, Collins is attempting to defend a doctrine of
emergent properties that does not become prominent in English
philosophy until Mill&rsquo;s <em>System of Logic</em> (1843).</p>

<h2 id="DeteFreeWill">3. Determinism and Free Will</h2>

<h3 id="Back">3.1 Background</h3>

<p>
Collins deals in passing with determinism and freedom of the will in
the 1707&ndash;08 correspondence with Samuel Clarke and in his 1707
book <em>An Essay concerning the Use of Reason</em>. His <em>A
Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Liberty</em> of 1717 is entirely
devoted to the issue. From the beginning, Collins is a determinist
with a compatibilist account of free action. Clarke attacked
Collins&rsquo; determinism in the 1707&ndash;08 correspondence. He
also reviewed the 1717 book and defended a doctrine of libertarian
free will as he had in the earlier correspondence.</p>

<p>
Since the nature of human choices and action are central to debates
about free will and determinism there is a close connection between
positions about these issues and positions about consciousness and
personal identity. The kind of determinism that Collins advocates is a
natural extension of his materialist, empirical and naturalistic
account of consciousness. In his account of consciousness, Collins
makes the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain the most basic
motives of action. This makes happiness and misery necessary
concomitants of consciousness, and thus conscious beings are endowed
with a desire for happiness. This is true as much of animals as it is
of human beings and accounts for a large number of similarities in the
behavior of humans and animals. Collins holds that if the behavior of
animals is determined, then that of humans must be as well.</p>

<h3 id="DeteCollEarlWork">3.2 Determinism in Collins&rsquo; early works</h3>

<p>
In the Clarke Collins correspondence of 1707&ndash;08 Collins claims
that Clarke&rsquo;s argument for dualism is useless to religion and
morality because of the problem of explaining how the immaterial mind
and the material body interact. One of Clarke&rsquo;s counter-charges
is that Collins&rsquo; materialism is dangerous to religion and
morality because it implies a determinism that is destructive of
religion and morality.</p>

<p>
Collins claims that human action is caused in much the same way as the
actions of clocks. Both are necessary agents, though the causes that
produce the action in either case are very different. &ldquo;Both are
necessarily determined in their Actions: the one by the Appearances of
Good and Evil, the other by a Weight or Spring&rdquo; (Clarke 1738
[1928: 872]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 226). Collins also attacks the
free will position. He holds that the same causes will always produce
the same effects and claims that the free will explanation of being
able to do otherwise violates this basic principle of causal
explanations (Clarke 1738 [1928: 873 and 874]; Clarke and Collins
2011: 227 and 230).</p>

<p>
Collins also expressed determinist views in his first
book&mdash;<em>An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason</em>, 1707. He
does this in the context of the problem of reconciling God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge with human free will. As O&rsquo;Higgins puts it:
&ldquo;He solved the problem to his own satisfaction by saying that
all things, including human choices, are determined in their causes
and as such can be foreseen by an all-knowing God&rdquo;
(O&rsquo;Higgins 1976: 6). This view also plays a role in
Collins&rsquo; 1710 critique of Archbishop King&rsquo;s views about
the problem of evil and the epistemological status of the attributes
of God. King claimed that God&rsquo;s attributes, including his
foreknowledge of events, was analogical. In the case of God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge, he did this to avoid contradictions between God&rsquo;s
knowing what was to come and the contingency of events and human free
will. Collins is content to reject human free will and to suppose that
&lsquo;foreknowledge&rsquo; has a univocal meaning when used with
reference to God or humans.</p>

<h3 id="PhilInquConcHumaLibe1717">3.3 <em>A Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty</em>, 1717</h3>

<p>
In <em>A Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty</em> Collins
briefly states his position. He rejects the view that there is any
freedom from necessity and claims that insofar as there is human
freedom it is &ldquo;liberty or freedom from outward impediment to
action.&rdquo; Such freedom is compatible with necessity. Collins
holds that every action has been caused and must necessarily have
occurred. The future is as much determined as the past. He then gives
six arguments for this form of determinism.</p>

<p>
The first of Collins&rsquo; arguments has to do with experience.
Defenders of free will hold that the experience of even ordinary
people shows that they choose freely. Collins&rsquo; response is much
the same as that of Hobbes and Spinoza. He claims that that those who
say such things are either not attending to, or not seeing, the causes
of their actions. Collins goes on to claim that some defenders of free
will admit that the issues are tangled and not to be resolved by
appeals to vulgar experience.</p>

<p>
William Rowe notes that Collins and Clarke share a volitional theory
of action. Rowe describes the theory in this way: &ldquo;According to
this theory, actions are of two sorts: thoughts and motions of the
body. What makes a thought or bodily motion an action is its being
preceded by a certain act of will (volitions) which bring about the
thought or motion. Volitions, then, are &lsquo;action
starters&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rowe 1987: 54). Rowe also notes that Collins
and Clarke share the assumption that if a volition is causally
determined then the person doing the act does not have free will
(1987: 53). Rowe says that as the two antagonists agree on these
points, they play little or no part in the debate. But they do explain
the strategy that Collins uses to argue that experience actually shows
that we are determined. He examines experience under four topics
relating to choice and action: (1) Perception of Ideas; (2) Judging of
Propositions; (3) Willing; and (4) Doing as we will. Collins argues
that each of these is causally determined.</p>

<p>
In respect to perception he holds that perception, both of ideas of
sensation and reflection, is not even voluntary. So, perception can
hardly be free. In respect to judging, he claims that we judge in
terms of how things appear to us, and that we can&rsquo;t change these
appearances. In respect to the will, he claims that there are two
questions to be considered. One is whether we are at liberty to will
or not. The second is whether we are at liberty to will &ldquo;one or
the other of two or more objects.&rdquo; In respect to the first
question he claims that Locke made a mistake in holding that people
are at liberty to will because they can suspend willing. So, Collins
holds that Locke&rsquo;s answer to the first question would be
affirmative. Collins claims that suspense of willing is as much an act
of will as any other. So, his answer is negative. In respect to the
second question Collins argues for a value determinism that makes the
answer to the second question negative as well. In defining willing,
he remarks: &ldquo;Willing or preferring is the same with respect to
good and evil, that judging is with respect to truth or
falsehood.&rdquo; So, if something seems better than the alternatives
we will choose it. Collins is thus a moral determinist who holds that
we must do what seems best to us. In giving his negative answer to his
second question, Collins is also rejecting the claim that we could
have done otherwise. Collins then proceeds to consider cases where we
can see no difference between the objects we are to choose among,
e.g., which of two eggs we will take. Collins&rsquo; response is
that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not enough to render things equal to the will, that they are
equal or alike in themselves. All the various modifications of the
man, his opinions, prejudices, temper, habit and circumstances, are to
be taken in and considered as causes of election no less than the
objects without us among which we chuse; and these will ever incline
or determine our wills, and make the choice we do make, preferable to
us, though the external objects of our choice are ever so much alike
to each other. (O&rsquo;Higgins 1976: 47)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If one were truly indifferent one simply would not choose. But once
there is a will to choose, the cascade of causes that leads to action
will determine the choice one way or the other. What Collins means by
&ldquo;doing as we will&rdquo; is what we do consequent to willing.
Here again he finds no freedom from necessity. We do what we have
willed unless some external impediment or intervening cause hinders us
from doing so. Finally, he compares the actions of animals to those of
men. He claims that while animals are supposed to be necessary agents
and humans free agents, there is no perceivable difference between
their actions that would allow us to make this distinction.</p>

<p>
Collins&rsquo; second argument is that man is a necessary agent
because all his actions have a beginning. He holds that whatever has a
beginning has a cause and all causes are necessary. Collins (as he had
in the Collins Clarke controversy) also rejects the proposition that
the same causes could produce different effects. Thus Collins rejects
the doctrine of free will because it violates the basic principle of
causal explanations. The third argument claimed that liberty is an
imperfection. Going back to judging propositions, Collins points out
that if we were free, we would be able to judge probable what is
improbable, and so on. This is the analog of moral determinism to the
epistemic realm. Just as we are not free to knowingly choose the worse
over the better, we cannot affirm that what seems improbable to us is
the probable. If we could we would be worse off than we are. The
fourth argument is that liberty is inconsistent with God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge. This is again similar to the view that Hobbes held and
repeats the assertions of Collins&rsquo; first book <em>An Essay
concerning the Use of Reason</em>. The fifth is that if man were not a
necessary agent, and determined by pleasure and pain, there would be
no foundation for rewards and punishments. The sixth is that if a man
were not a necessary agent he would be ignorant of morality and have
no motive to practice it. These last two arguments make the point that
causality is necessary for the operation of morality in the world, and
to introduce a causeless free will is to make the teaching of morality
or its motivation by punishment or reward pointless.</p>

<p>
Jacopo Agnesina has recently argued that the <em>An Inquiry Concerning
Human Liberty</em> was in fact a response to Dr. Clarke and rational
theology. Agnesina claims that Collins was attempting to demonstrate
that determinism follows from Clarke&rsquo;s first principles
(Agnesina 2011). Interestingly, there was only one response to
Collins&rsquo; book in England. Samuel Clarke reviewed it and argued
that the notion of a &ldquo;necessary agent&rdquo; was incoherent, for
to be an agent one must be active and Collins&rsquo; position was that
the humans are completely passive and thus (in Clarke&rsquo;s sense)
not agents at all. Clarke charges that in discussing being able to do
otherwise, Collins fails to distinguish between physical and moral
necessity (see Harris 2005: 59). Clarke also complained that Collins
treated perception as actions when perception is passive (Clarke 1738
[1928: 722]). Clarke develops his own account of free will arguing
that motives, pleasures and pains, reasons and arguments, are simply
occasions for the self-moving power that is active to freely determine
action. What we have again is a competing set of explanations for the
same phenomena. Clarke failed to take a number of Collins&rsquo;
arguments seriously, because the free will arguments being refuted
were not his arguments.</p>

<p>
In a series of letters Collins discussed Clarke&rsquo;s review of his
book with his long time friend and collaborator Pierre Desmaizeaux. He
had written up a reply. Eventually, however, Collins concluded that
Clarke had been threatening him with civil action, and that to reply
would provide Clarke with the opportunity to do so (Dybikowski 2011:
260&ndash;1, 269 and 281). Consequently Collins made no reply to
Clarke&rsquo;s review. In 1729 a short book, <em>A Dissertation of
Liberty and Necessity</em>, with the initials A.C. on the title page,
was published. For a number of reasons O&rsquo;Higgins holds that
Collins is not the author of this work. His first reason is that the
book treats the substance of the soul as unknown&mdash;a Lockean
doctrine that Collins had rejected. O&rsquo;Higgins also cites
contemporary reviews that claim the arguments of the book are weak
compared to the <em>Inquiry</em>. Still, weak or not, the arguments
are certainly consistent with the determinist position that Collins
was holding in the earlier work. The author also takes into account at
least one of Clarke&rsquo;s criticisms of the <em>Inquiry</em>.</p>

<p>
The author of <em>A Dissertation</em> remarks that he will
&ldquo;attempt to solve the Point of Free Will, by tracing the
progress of the Soul through all its Operations which we are conscious
of, and examining in each whether &lsquo;tis Active or
Passive&rsquo;&rdquo; (Collins 1729: 1). The point is that at every
stage in the process, from perception to action, we are passive. The
author apparently accepted Clarke&rsquo;s point in his review of
Collins&rsquo; <em>Inquiry</em> that perception is not an action, for
he is now calling it not an &lsquo;action&rsquo; but an
&lsquo;operation.&rsquo; The author explicitly takes up Clarke&rsquo;s
views when he argues that we are passive in judgment. He quotes Clarke
at length. Clarke holds that judgment is passive, but distinguishes
between judging and acting. The author continues: &ldquo;But I
conceive the doctor here begs the Question, by asserting the
Self-motive Power in the Soul without proving it, and then reasons
from it as granted to him&rdquo; (1729: 6). The author of <em>A
Dissertation</em> thus returns to Clarke a charge that Clarke had made
about Collins in his 1717 review of <em>A Philosophical Inquiry
Concerning Human Liberty</em>.</p>

<h2 id="CollDeisFree">4. Collins, Deism and Freethinking</h2>

<p>
The 17th and early 18th century in England saw a rationalist treatment
of theology that spanned many competing groups from the
Latitudinarians to the Dissenters to the Deists. Samuel Hefelbower in
<em>The Relation of John Locke to English Deism</em> remarks that
among the progressives&mdash;theologians, philosophers and
deists&mdash;all accepted a rationalistic religion. The question then
becomes what exactly is the role of reason vis &agrave; vis
revelation. The discussion of the relation of reason to revelation
goes back at least to Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas&mdash;that is
to the scholastic authorities. Albert held that reason has a role to
play in religion, but there are questions where philosophy has no
final answer and revelation must decide. Revelation is above reason
but not contrary to it. Thomas has a similar position (Hefelbower
1918: 47). Locke holds that reason is responsible for determining what
counts as genuine revelation. Locke also holds the view that there is
revelation that tells us about things above reason but not contrary to
it. &ldquo;Thus that part of the Angels rebelled against GOD, and
thereby lost their first happy state: And that the dead shall rise,
and live again: These, and the like, being beyond the Discovery of
Reason, are purely matters of Faith, with which Reason has directly,
nothing to do&rdquo; (IV. XVIII. 7. 10&ndash;14 p. 694). The Deists
tend to hold a more radical view than the one that Locke
advocates.</p>

<p>
Samuel Clarke in his Boyle lectures of 1704 distinguishes four grades
of deists. First there were those who acknowledged a future life and
other doctrines of natural religion. Second were those who while
denying a future life, admitted the moral role of the deity. Third are
those who acknowledged providence in natural religion, but not in
morality. And finally, those who denied providence altogether. Where
does Collins fit, in these grades of deism? According to
O&rsquo;Higgins: &ldquo;In his books, Collins came to emphasize the
part that morality should play in religion and to assert the
importance of natural religion&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 40).
Collins claims to believe in a future life (if not natural
immortality). Collins rejects Revelation. So, if O&rsquo;Higgins is
right, Collins fits Clarke&rsquo;s first grade of deists. David Berman
has disputed this view, arguing that Collins is, in fact, an
atheist.</p>

<h3 id="EssaConcUseReas1707">4.1 <em>An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason</em>, 1707</h3>

<p>
<em>An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason</em>, Collins&rsquo; first
book, was published anonymously in 1707. The main thrust of the book
is to reject religious mysteries. Collins starts his approach to the
issues of religion and reason along the same lines that Locke does. He
defines reason as &ldquo;that faculty of the Mind, whereby it
perceives the truth, Falsehood, Probability or Improbability of
Propositions&rdquo; (1707 [1984: 3]). Propositions consist of words
&ldquo;which stand for Ideas concerning which some agreement is
affirm&rsquo;d or deny&rsquo;d&rdquo; (1707 [1984: 3&ndash;4]). Thus
he accepts Locke&rsquo;s definition of knowledge. He also
distinguishes in the way Locke does intuitive, demonstrative and
probable truths, and treats claims about revelation as probable
propositions that largely derive from testimony. Perhaps one diversion
from Locke is that Collins distinguishes between two different kinds
of probability. The stronger kind resembles demonstration but the
connection between ideas is merely probable. The weaker kind of
probability is testimony. Collins&rsquo; position is that a person is
not expected to believe anything that is not comprehensible by the
human intellect. So, if terms take on meanings that cannot be
understood, humans cannot be expected to believe them.</p>

<p>
O&rsquo;Higgins sees a strong affinity between Collins&rsquo; book and
John Toland&rsquo;s <em>Christianity Not Mysterious</em>, which had
been published in 1696. He quotes Toland&rsquo;s remark that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We hold that reason is the only foundation of all
certitude&hellip;that nothing reveal&rsquo;d, whether as to its manner
or to its existence, is more exempted from its disquisitions, than the
ordinary phenomena of nature&hellip;that there is nothing in the
gospel contrary to or above it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
O&rsquo;Higgins claims that this is very much the position that
Collins is taking in the <em>Essay</em>. There is, however, some
reason to doubt that O&rsquo;Higgins is correct in equating
Collins&rsquo; position with that of Toland. It depends on how we
interpret the phrase &ldquo;contrary to or above it.&rdquo; Does this
mean that Toland rejects all truths above <em>and</em> contrary to
reason or that Toland rejects the claim not only that there are no
truths contrary to reason in the gospel but also no truths above
it&mdash;even those compatible with it? If the first interpretation is
correct, then O&rsquo;Higgins is very likely correct in claiming that
Collins and Toland are holding the same position, but if the second is
correct then their positions are likely distinct.</p>

<p>
In <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> Locke allowed that
there were some truths that were above reason but compatible with it.
Some scholars regard this as a mere verbal commitment to truths above
reason, while others regard it as substantive. What is clear is that
Locke would not accept truths above and contrary to reason. On this
point, Locke, Toland, and Collins are in complete agreement. Collins,
for example, claims that the distinction between reasonable
propositions and &ldquo;things above, and things contrary to
reason&rdquo; is the distinction that theologians use on behalf of
mysteries and theological contradictions against those who say that
they can only believe what they understand (Collins 1707 [1984: 24]).
Toland, however, has a more radical position than Locke in that he
rejects truths above reason, even where these truths are compatible
with reason (see Woolhouse 2007: 372). Thus Toland might well not
accept the story of the rebellion of the angels or the claim that the
dead shall rise. Collins, on the other hand, seems to hold the same
position Locke does. He quotes with approval a passage from Boyle who
uses an analogy of a deep sea diver to clarify the issue. If the diver
asks you if you can see to the bottom of the ocean and after you have
declared that you cannot, brings up oysters with pearls in them, you
will have no objection to the claim that there are oysters with pearls
in them at the bottom of the sea. If, on the other hand, the diver
claims that the pearls he shows you are larger than the shells
containing them, &ldquo;you would doubtless judge what he asserts
contrary to the information of your eyes&rdquo; (Collins 1707 [1984:
25&ndash;6]) Turning from analogy to theological doctrines, we find
that Collins accepts, for example, the resurrection of Christ while
rejecting transubstantiation (1707 [1984: 24]). Collins also objects
to the doctrine of the Trinity because it is not understandable and on
some interpretations involves contradictions. Acceptance of the
doctrine of the Trinity is the first of the Thirty-nine Articles to
which an Anglican was supposed to subscribe. It is plain that Collins,
like Locke, Newton, Clarke, Whiston, Toland and others, objected to
this article. Many of these men concealed their views about the
Trinity and claimed that they were orthodox Anglicans. At any rate, it
seems clear that Collins holds much the same position as Locke in
respect to truths that are merely above reason and truths that are
both above and contrary to reason. </p>

<h3 id="AnalLang">4.2 Analogical language</h3>

<p>
In <em>A Vindication of the Divine Attributes, in some Remarks on His
Grace the Archbishop of Dublin&rsquo;s sermon intitled &ldquo;Divine
Predestination Consistent with the Freedom of Man&rsquo;s
Will&rdquo;</em>, (published in 1710) Collins takes on another way of
evading his demand that whatever we believe must be comprehensible to
us. This is the doctrine of analogy that goes back to St. Thomas
Aquinas. The form in which Collins finds it in the works of Archbishop
King of Dublin, is the doctrine that not only does God not have hands
and feet and a beard in a literal sense, he does not have wisdom,
benevolence or justice in any sense that we can understand these
terms. Thus King remarked: &ldquo;It does not follow from hence, that
any of these are more properly or literally in God after the manner
they are in us, than hands or eyes, than mercy, than love or hatred
are.&rdquo; Collins rejects the claim that God&rsquo;s wisdom and
benevolence could have meanings that we do not comprehend. He asserts
that God&rsquo;s knowledge and his attributes are univocal with ours
(O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 63).</p>

<p>
David Berman in his <em>A History of Atheism in Great Britain</em>,
gives a number of reasons to take Collins as an atheist rather than a
deist. He sees Collins&rsquo; account of the creation of matter <em>ex
nihilo</em> in the Answer to Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s Third Defence as an
argument for atheism disguised as an argument against atheism (Berman
1988: 80&ndash;81). He sees Collins as using Bayle to raise the
problem of evil in the <em>Vindication of the Divine Attributes</em>
and then showing that both the solution offered by Bayle and Dr. King
are unacceptable. Collins&rsquo; official position at the end of the
<em>Vindication</em> is that King is wrong but atheism is avoidable.
Berman asks what the actual conclusion of the <em>Vindication</em> is.
He continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is simply that there are very formidable, or insuperable,
difficulties in the theistic conception of God&mdash;revealed by the
Manichean problems&mdash;and that the latest attempt to cope with, or
solve, these difficulties, i.e. King&rsquo;s theory, has failed; for
the medicine is as bad as the disease. But the disease remains!
(Berman 1988: 84)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Collins clearly rejects theism based on revelation. But one could also
be a theist based on arguments from natural religion. Berman sees the
<em>Vindication</em> as aimed at the heart of natural religion (1988:
84). If this were so, we would have good reason to regard Collins as
an atheist. On the one hand, Collins&rsquo; position about analogical
language may seem to strongly support natural religion. Insofar as the
meaning of the divine attributes is univocal with our use of the same
words about human beings, the analogy that natural religion relies on
would work at its best. (The basic analogy on which natural religion
depends is that humans are to the machines they make as God is to the
world.) Archbishop King&rsquo;s position, on the other hand, would
completely undermine the analogy. There is, however, a second
consideration. Insofar as the problem of evil is left unresolved in
natural religion, it would suggest that it can provide no effective
answer to this fundamental difficulty in theism. This is
Berman&rsquo;s point. O&rsquo;Higgins, by contrast, claims that in the
<em>Vindication</em> Collins simply sets aside the problem of evil
(O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 63).</p>

<h3 id="DiscFreeThin1713">4.3 <em>A Discourse of Free Thinking</em>, 1713</h3>

<p>
Like Locke, Collins is an advocate of the use of reason to determine
religious truths. One necessary condition for being able to think
freely is not to be persecuted for considering views that are
different from the accepted ones. Only in such an environment can one
genuinely consider alternatives. It must be possible to adopt
whichever of the possibilities turns out to be the most reasonable.
Collins, like Locke, is committed to the view that one should
proportion assent to a proposition on the basis of the evidence for
it. Religious persecution aims to limit the possibilities and the
evidence that one can consider. Though Collins was strongly
anti-clerical, he does distinguish between good priests and bad
priests. The good priests are the ones who advocate freedom of
thought; the bad priests, on the other hand, are persecutors who want
to prevent people from thinking through the truths of religion for
themselves. In his own time, Collins&rsquo; most controversial work
was his <em>A Discourse of Freethinking</em> (1714).</p>

<p>
Concerning the <em>Discourse</em>, J.M. Robertson writes that it
&ldquo;&hellip;may be said to sum up and unify the drift not only of
previous English freethinking, but of the great contribution of Bayle,
whose learning and temper influence all English deism from Shaftesbury
onward&rdquo; (Robertson 1936: 722). Perhaps the motto of <em>A
Discourse of Free-Thinking</em> ought to be &ldquo;Where experts
disagree, any person is free to reason for themselves.&rdquo; Collins
is chiefly concerned with religion, so the vast bulk of the
disagreements he cites have to do with religious issues, from whether
one religion is better than another, down to the details of
Anglicanism. Looking at conflicting claims often leads to skepticism.
Where exactly this approach leads Collins is a question that we will
have to consider.</p>

<p>
In <em>A Discourse of Free-thinking</em> Collins defines free-thinking
as &ldquo;The Use of the Understanding, in endeavouring to find out
the Meaning of any Proposition whatsoever, in considering the nature
and Evidence for or against it, and in judging of it according to the
seeming Force or Weakness of the Evidence&rdquo; (1713: 5). Collins
claims that we have a right to think freely. Richard Bently in his
<em>Remarks about a Late Discourse of Free-Thinking</em> charges that
this definition is too broad&mdash;that it amounts to a definition of
thinking. James O&rsquo;Higgins in his study of Collins agrees with
Bently. This, however, is not a good evaluation. Collins&rsquo;
account is surely intended to rule out believing without evidence, or
against the evidence, or without carefully considering conflicting
evidence. Either these are not going to be admitted as thinking at
all, or Collins&rsquo; definition is not too broad.</p>

<p>
The <em>Discourse</em> is divided into three sections. In the first
two Collins gives a series of arguments in favor of free-thinking and
in the third he answers objections to free-thinking and gives a list
of historical figures who he views as free-thinkers. The arguments
treat thinking effectively as like a craft or art and a number of the
early arguments work on this analogy. He claims that just as putting
restrictions on painting would reduce the proficiency of the painter,
so putting restrictions on thinking can only reduce the proficiency of
the thinker. To fail to think freely leads to the holding of absurd
beliefs and superstition. Collins gives a brief history of the efforts
of priests to control what people believe by fraud from the ancient
world to the Reformation. Collins then claims that free-thinking is
responsible for the decline in the belief in witchcraft.</p>

<p>
Section 2 begins with Collins arguing that right opinion in matters of
religion is supposed to be essential to salvation and errors to lead
to damnation. But if one is not to think freely oneself about such
subjects, then one must simply take up the opinions of those among
whom one happens to live. But this means that they will only be right
by accident. On the other hand, if people think freely, they will have
&ldquo;the evidence of things to determine them to the side of
truth&rdquo; (1713: 33). There are in all ages an infinite number of
pretenders to revelations from Heaven, supported by miracles. These
pretenders offer new notions of the Deity, new doctrines, commands,
ceremonies and modes of worship. To decide which of these are genuine
and which spurious requires that one think freely about the competing
evidence that would show that one is genuine while the other an
imposter. Collins remarks that since the Anglican Church has an
organization to support foreign missionaries (The Society for
Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Lands) this really requires
supporting free-thinking throughout the world and therefore at home as
well. Indeed: &ldquo;As there can be no reasonable change of opinions
among men, no quitting of any old religion, no reception of any new
religion, nor believing any religion at all, but by means of
free-thinking; so the Holy Scriptures agreeably to reason, and to the
design of our blessed Savior of establishing his religion throughout
the whole universe, imply everywhere and press in many places the duty
of free thinking&rdquo; (1713: 43&ndash;6). Finally Collins claims
that the conduct of the priests &ldquo;who are the chief Pretenders to
be the Guides to others in matters of Religion, makes free-thinking on
the nature and attributes of the eternal being of God, on the
authority of the scriptures, and on the sense of scriptures,
unavoidable&rdquo; (1713: 46). He goes on to list disagreements and
differences of opinion among priests on all these topics.</p>

<p>
In section 3 Collins takes up various objections to free-thinking. To
suppose that all men have a right to think freely on all subjects is
to suppose that they have the capacity to do so. But they do not. So
it is absurd to think that they have a duty to think freely. Collins
replies that to suppose a right to a thing &ldquo;also implies a Right
in him to let it alone, if he thinks fit&rdquo; (1713: 100). As for
free-thinking being a duty, Collins responds that it is so only in
cases where those who contend &ldquo;for the Necessity of all
Men&rsquo;s assenting to certain Propositions, must allow that men are
qualify&rsquo;d to do so&rdquo; (<em>ibid</em>.). If it were the case
that the great bulk of mankind lacked the capacity to think freely on
matters of speculation, then the priests should conclude that men
should in no way be concerned about truth and falsehood in speculative
matters. In short, they should hold no opinion. Even in this case,
however, the right to think freely would remain untouched in those
disposed to think freely. The second objection is that to encourage
free-thinking &ldquo;will produce endless Divisions of Opinion and by
consequence Disorders in Society.&rdquo; Collins suggests that the
consequence is false and that any remedy is worse than the disease.
Third, free-thinking may lead to atheism. Collins points out that many
divines hold that there never was a real atheist in the world while
Bacon holds that contemplative atheists are rare. Still, even if
free-thinking were to produce many atheists, the number of those who
are superstitious or enthusiastic that will be produced in the absence
of free-thinking is even greater. And these are worse evils for
society than atheism. Fourthly, priests are the experts who are to be
relied upon in their subject as doctors and lawyers are to be relied
upon in theirs. Collins argues that the analogy between doctors and
lawyers and priests does not hold. First, while doctors and lawyers
act for us, we need not believe the principles or opinions on which
one prescribes and the other acts. But in matters of religion,
&ldquo;I am obliged to believe certain opinions myself. No man&rsquo;s
belief will save me except my own&rdquo; (1713: 109). Finally,
free-thinkers are &ldquo;the most infamous, wicked and senseless of
all mankind&rdquo; (1713: 118). Collins answers this objection in
various ways&mdash;arguing that in fact free-thinking makes one
virtuous. He ends by listing a variety of men he considers
free-thinkers whose moral character was impeccable&mdash;Socrates,
Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Plutarch, Cicero, Varo and others among
the ancients. Among the moderns he includes, Bacon, Hobbes and
Archbishop Tillotson.</p>

<h3 id="InteDiscFreeThin">4.4 Interpreting <em>A Discourse of Free Thinking</em></h3>

<p>
The <em>Discourse</em> leaves us with a variety of questions. What
exactly is Collins trying to achieve in this book? Reflecting on the
first two sections of the <em>Discourse</em>, James O&rsquo;Higgins
notes: &ldquo;A good deal of what he wrote can be interpreted as the
writing of an anti-clerical protestant, insisting on private judgment
for the laity. A few other passages&hellip;such as those from Varo and
Socrates, seem to imply a bias against Christianity itself, or at
least against Revelation&rdquo; (1970: 89). Some of Collins&rsquo;
critics accused him of being an atheist. But, unless one gives the
work an esoteric reading, this hardly seems warranted. Collins is,
however, clearly extolling a universal religion based on reason.</p>

<p>
The <em>Discourse</em> received a good number of replies. Steele
commented that the author of the <em>Discourse</em> deserved &ldquo;to
be denied the common benefits of air and water&rdquo; (quoted in
O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 78). The <em>Guardian</em> campaigned against
the <em>Discourse</em>. Among the articles it published were some by
the young George Berkeley. There is a certain amount of scholarly
debate about how effective these replies were. From early on,
historians have often claimed that Richard Bently in his <em>Remarks
about a late Discourse of Freethinking</em> delivered a crushing
rejoinder to Collins. Robertson pretty much alone rejected this
opinion. James O&rsquo;Higgins in his book-length study of Collins
probably gives the most balanced assessment. O&rsquo;Higgins admits
that Bently, on the whole, makes a strictly <em>ad hominem</em> attack
on Collins. He attacked Collins&rsquo; scholarship and accused him of
atheism. O&rsquo;Higgins thinks that Bently succeeded in showing that
&ldquo;Collins was not the man to produce a critical edition of the
Bible&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 84). O&rsquo;Higgins also remarks
that Bently correctly points out that Collins did not understand the
role of textual variants in reducing (rather than increasing) our
uncertainty about the meaning of a text. Since Collins is maintaining
that everyone capable of doing so should reason about religious
matters, claims that he failed to reason correctly may have more bite
to them than other <em>ad hominem</em> arguments. But while these are
good points, set against the fact that Bently completely failed to
address the main issue of religious authority, this can hardly amount
to a crushing rejoinder. Robertson is also surely right in holding
that Collins&rsquo; scholarship is not as bad as Bently claimed and
that Bently&rsquo;s scholarship is often not as good as historians
have claimed.</p>

<h2 id="CollReli">5. Collins and Religion</h2>

<p>
Edward and Lillian Bloom note in their introduction to <em>A Discourse
Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</em> that: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For several years and in such works as <em>Priestcraft in
Perfection</em> (1710) and <em>A Discourse of Free-Thinking</em>
(1713), he was a flailing polemicist against the entire Anglican
hierarchy. Not until 1724 did he become a polished debater, when he
initiated a controversy that made &ldquo;a very great noise&rdquo; and
which ended only with his death. The loudest shot in the persistent
barrage was sounded by <em>Grounds and Reasons</em> and its last
fusillade by the <em>Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in
Writing</em>. (Collins 1729 [1970: iii])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In <em>Priestcraft in Perfection</em>, 1710, and <em>An Historical and
Critical Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of
England</em>, 1724, Collins attacks the first clause of Article 20 of
the 39 articles: &ldquo;The Church hath power to decree rites or
ceremonies, and authority in controversies of faith.&rdquo; Collins
goes over the history of the clause in considerable detail to argue
that it is a forgery. Clearly if this were a forgery, the church would
have no power to decree rites nor authority in controversies of faith.
The point is that: &ldquo;&hellip;the just and true establishment of
religion lies, in allowing every man to have a conscience of his own;
to use and follow his own private judgment; and particularly, to
understand, profess and practice, what he thinks God teaches in the
holy scriptures&rdquo; (Collins, Preface to the <em>Essay</em>, quoted
in O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 143&ndash;4). O&rsquo;Higgins notes that this
might be the position of any dissenting minister. O&rsquo;Higgins
gives a detailed summary of the controversy in Chapter IX of his study
of Collins.</p>

<p>
In <em>A Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian
Religion</em>, 1724, Collins attacks the basis of Christianity as a
revealed religion. In <em>The Reasonableness of Christianity</em>,
Locke had made the messiahship of Christ the single fundamental tenet
for being a Christian. In the <em>Discourse</em> Collins is rejecting
it. The argument is that Christianity is founded on Judaism, or the
New Testament on the Old. The New Testament is only of importance in
this regard insofar as it shows that the prophecies of the Old are
fulfilled. Collins rejects the claim that they are fulfilled in the
New Testament.This, he claims, is the only proof for Christianity.
Collins&rsquo; critics disputed this claim; there was the proof from
miracles. But Collins rejected such proofs.</p>

<p>
In rejecting the argument from prophecies Collins is once again
jousting with the Newtonians. William Whiston (1667&ndash;1752) was a
close associate of Newton&rsquo;s and was probably influenced by
Newton&rsquo;s interest in prophetic arguments. Stephen Snobelen
points out in his review of the controversy that Whiston hoped to set
up an exact science of prophecies. As Snobelen notes: &ldquo;For
Whiston, fulfilled prophecy was as certain as a Boylean experiment or
a Newtonian demonstration&rdquo;(Snobelen 1996: 205). Collins shared
much of Whiston&rsquo;s desire for precision. Often it was allowed
that a prophecy in the Old Testament had dual fulfillments, one in the
prophet&rsquo;s own day and one in the more remote future. One of
these was supposed to be literal, the other allegorical. Both Whiston
and Collins reject &lsquo;allegorical&rsquo; interpretations for
literal ones. But while Whiston regarded the later fulfillment as
literal and the earlier as allegorical, Collins insisted that it was
the earlier one that should be regarded as literal.</p>

<p>
Using the catalog of Collins&rsquo; library produced by Giovanni
Tarantino, Jacopo Agnesina has persuasively argued that <em>A
Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</em> published in
1729 is a genuine work of Anthony Collins, though O&rsquo;Higgins in
his biography of Collins doubted its authenticity (Agnesina 2009).
Edward and Lillian Bloom in their introduction to their reprint of the
<em>Discourse</em> remark that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For the modern reader, the <em>Discourse concerning Ridicule and
Irony</em> is the most satisfying of Collins&rsquo;s many pamphlets
and books. It lacks the pretentiousness of the <em>Scheme</em>, the
snide convolutions of the <em>Grounds and Reasons</em>, the argument
by half-truths of the <em>Discourse of Free-Thinking</em>. His last
work is free of the curious ambivalence which marked so many of his
earlier pieces, a visible uncertainty that made him fear repression
and yet court it. On the contrary, his last work is in fact a
justification of his rhetorical mode and religious beliefs; it is an
<em>apologia pro vita sua</em> written with all the intensity and
decisiveness that such a justification demands. (Collins 1729 [1970:
xv])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The aim of the <em>Discourse</em> is to refute a claim by Nathanael
Marshall that while serious arguments about religious issues should be
allowed, ridicule and irony in attacks on established religion should
be prosecuted by the magistrate. This is a clear indication of how
much his Anglican opponents had let Collins&rsquo; irreverent wit,
biting satire and ironical remarks get under their skin.
Collins&rsquo; opponent was vulnerable on a number of points and
Collins makes telling arguments against his claim. He notes that the
best writers on religion will be found to be committing these crimes
in disputation; that the best punishment would be either to be ignored
or to return ridicule with ridicule &ndash; rather than to be punished
by the magistrate. He points out that when Mr. Marshall discovers how
many of those who practice these crimes are of his party and are
encouraged in these practices he will give up his position, and so on.
The theme of allowing liberty of discourse in public debates about
religion is the over-arching theme of the <em>Discourse</em>, and it
is certainly one of the main themes of Collins&rsquo; work throughout
his life.</p>

<h2 id="Infl">6. Influences</h2>

<h3 id="Engl">6.1 In England</h3>

<p>
We have already considered in some detail Samuel Clarke&rsquo;s
reaction to Collins&rsquo; views about emergent properties, personal
identity and issues about determinism and free will in the early
eighteenth century. The Collins Clarke correspondence of 1706&ndash;08
was reprinted twice and referred to many times in the course of the
eighteenth century (Martin and Barresi 2000: 33). The conservative
reaction to Locke and Collins concerning personal identity and
materialism represented by Clarke continued to be maintained by many
thinkers in eighteenth century England as well as on the continent. In
fact, we can see an on-going debate between the materialists and
dualists on these topics all the way through the eighteenth and into
the early nineteenth century in England.</p>

<p>
Bishop Joseph Butler (1692&ndash;1752) a protege of Samuel Clarke
attacked the Locke/Collins account of personal identity in the
Appendix on Personal Identity to his <em>Analogy of Religion</em>.
Butler largely accepted Clarke&rsquo;s substantialist account of
identity and personal identity. Indeed he clarified Clarke&rsquo;s
position by summarizing it briefly and naming the distinction Clarke
had been making between real and fictional identity. He called it the
distinction between identity in the strict and proper sense and
identity in the loose and popular sense (Ducharme 1986: 370). He
reiterates Clarke&rsquo;s claim that Collins&rsquo; account of
personal identity is dangerous to religion and in particular the
doctrine of the resurrection. He accused Collins of taking
Locke&rsquo;s doctrines &ldquo;to a strange length&rdquo; (Perry
2008: 102). By this Butler meant that Collins&rsquo; account of
personal identity would not allow a person&rsquo;s identity to persist
for more than a moment and thus that Locke&rsquo;s account of personal
identity implied and that Collins explicitly stated a doctrine of
successive persons. Butler claimed that such a doctrine would destroy
both morality and any doctrine of the resurrection. This has been an
influential misinterpretation of Collins (see Uzgalis 2008b).</p>

<p>
George Berkeley (1685&ndash;1753) met Collins at a freethinking coffee
house meeting and later told his American follower, Samuel Johnson,
that Collins was an atheist. As noted earlier, Berkeley attacked the
<em>Discourse of Free-Thinking</em> in Steele&rsquo;s
<em>Guardian</em>, and continued his attacks on Collins in
<em>Alciphron</em>. While Berkeley holds a quite distinct set of
philosophical views from those of Clarke, together they represent a
conservative Anglican response to Locke and Collins on the issue of
personal identity. Berkeley agrees with Clarke about the substantial
nature of persons.</p>

<p>
Scholars are still debating the influence of Collins on David Hume
(1711&ndash;1776). How much influence is attributed to Collins depends
largely on the interpretation given to Hume&rsquo;s philosophy (see
Macintyre 1994, Russell 1995, and Harris 2005). MacIntyre and Russell
despite their differences agree that in <em>A Treatise Of Human
Nature</em> Hume was systematically attacking Clarke&rsquo;s position
on the mind/body relation as articulated both in Clarke&rsquo;s Boyle
lectures and the Collins Clarke correspondence of 1706&ndash;08 and
that many of Hume&rsquo;s arguments resemble those of Collins. Harris,
focusing on the issue of free will and determinism and using the
<em>Enquiries</em> to interpret the Treatise, has a contrasting view.
He argues that Hume&rsquo;s account of necessity is weaker than
&ldquo;that defended by Collins and before him by Hobbes,&rdquo; and
he goes on to claim that in giving this weaker account Hume is giving
the same kind of account that Bramhall and Clarke gave in trying to
find a middle way between necessitarianism and the liberty of
indifference (Harris 2005: 73). Harris may be correct in noting a
variety of ways in which Hume&rsquo;s account of causality and
necessity differs from that of Hobbes, Locke and Collins. On the other
hand, he fails to note the important way in which Collins&rsquo;
claims that while some wholes are caused by a composition of their
parts there is a whole range of cases where this is not true
distinguishes his view from that of Hobbes and brings it closer to
Hume&rsquo;s. Hume&rsquo;s rejection of heirloom theories of causality
and the necessary connection that goes along with them undermines
Clarke&rsquo;s position on the causal relation of mind and body far
more than Harris seems to allow. I think these considerations tend to
weaken Harris&rsquo; judgement that while Collins is a dogmatist on
these issues, Hume is a skeptic (see Harris 2005: note 22 p. 79). </p>

<p>
Thomas Reid (1710&ndash;1796) holds positions on materialism, personal
identity and free will that have much in common with the views of
Clarke. Reid deploys reduplication arguments in objecting to the views
about personal identity of Joseph Priestly (see Martin and Barresi
2000: 47). Priestly&rsquo;s views have strong connections to those of
Collins and Locke.</p>

<p>
Joseph Priestley (1733&ndash;1804) was sufficiently impressed with
Collins&rsquo; <em>Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Free Will</em> to
arrange the publication of a new edition of that work. Priestley also
held that matter can think, but his views were based on a different
conception of matter than the one which Collins and Clarke shared.
Priestley had an active conception of matter derived from Boscovich.
Priestley was also impressed by Collins&rsquo; work on the prophecies
(Yolton 1983: 108&ndash;113).</p>

<h3 id="Cont">6.2 On the continent</h3>

<p>
Collins&rsquo; influence on the continent in the second half of the
eighteenth century was much more considerable than his influence in
England. O&rsquo;Higgins remarks that &ldquo;Small though his part in
English literature may have been, during his own lifetime there were
few English writers who were more fully reported in the continental
journals, or more noted in foreign universities&rdquo;
(O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 203). Pierre Desmaizeaux knew Collins for some
26 years and was his friend and collaborator. Desmaizeaux played an
important role in raising Collins&rsquo; reputation both in England
and on the continent. Collins discussed Clarke&rsquo;s response to his
book on determinism with Desmaizeaux and Desmaizeaux kept Collins in
contact with the intellectual life on the continent and also served as
a publicist for Collins. He had Collins&rsquo; <em>Inquiry</em>
translated into French and handled the printing of his other books. In
1720, under Collins&rsquo; direction, Desmaizeaux published <em>A
collection of several pieces of Mr. John Locke, never before printed,
or not extant in his works. Pub. by the author of the Life of the
ever-memorable Mr. John Hales, &amp;c</em> which contained a number of
Locke&rsquo;s letters to Collins. There was considerable interest on
the continent in the thinking-matter controversy. There is a certain
amount of debate about the influence of Collins&rsquo; book on free
will and determinism on Voltaire. O&rsquo;Higgins accepts the evidence
produced by Torrey in <em>Voltaire and the English Deists</em> that
Voltaire was converted to determinism by reading Collins
(O&rsquo;Higgins 1970: 219&ndash;20). As time passed free-thinking
came out into the open in France and Collins&rsquo; name was
associated with it. Finally, his works on the materiality of the soul,
determinism and free will and the prophecies influenced the group
around Baron d&rsquo;Holbach. (For a detailed treatment of
Collins&rsquo; influence on the continent, see O&rsquo;Higgins 1970:
Chapter XI.) Whether Collins would have been happy with this depends
on whether we view him as a deist with O&rsquo;Higgins, or as an
atheist with David Berman. This disagreement over whether to regard
Collins as a deist or as an atheist (or someone whose views changed
over time or were unclear even to himself) is our most serious
unresolved problem in determining Collins&rsquo; proper place in the
history of ideas.</p>

This is, in effect, a critical review of James O&rsquo;Higgins book
<em>Anthony Collins: The Man and His Work</em>. Berman fills in the
gaps that O&rsquo;Higgins account leaves in our understanding of
Collins. The article, then, is intended as a supplement to the book.
Berman paints a picture of Collins as a genuine lover of truth who
uses his wealth to create a research library used by many scholars. He
relates Collins to Locke and Berkeley in terms of the meaning of terms
for religious mysteries, e.g. the trinity, as well as in other
ways.</p></li>
