<h2>Dewey's Early Aesthetics</h2>

<h3>Aesthetics and Dewey's Theory of Education</h3>

<p>

 Much of Dewey's early interest in aesthetics centered around his
theory of childhood education. In a work from 1896,
&ldquo;Imagination and Expression,&rdquo; he stresses the importance
of directing the psychical impulse that provides the motive for
expression (Dewey 1896). Here, unlike later writings, he emphasizes
the distinction between the idea to be expressed and the technique by
which it is expressed. He argues that although technique should be
subservient to idea, it should not be neglected. He rejects the notion
that the idea is spiritual and the technique physical. However, in the
idealist vein typical of this period, he insists that the child draws
from his or her own image, not from the object, and concludes that
teachers should help children to present and construct complete images
having their own value.  </p>

<p>

 Throughout his early writings on education Dewey emphasized the
importance of aesthetic education. For instance, he writes about the
educational role of museums in <em>The School and Society</em> (1902). He locates a museum in the center of his ideal
school, his diagram of that school representing his effort to
synthesize the arts and sciences in education (Constantino 2004).</p>

<p>

 In his 1915 book <em>Democracy and Education</em>  Dewey
stresses that taste is determined by environment. If a child
constantly sees harmonious objects she will have a standard of taste,
whereas barren surroundings will eliminate her desire for
beauty. Standards are determined by the situations in which a person
habitually lives. Thus taste cannot be taught consciously through
second-hand information.</p>

<p>

 Dewey here emphasizes the connection between aesthetics and issues of
social justice. Those in society who contribute to the maintenance of
life or to its decoration cannot today have full and free interest in
their work. Instead of transforming things and making them more
significant, art today merely feeds fancy and indulgence. Dewey
insists that this sad state of affairs is caused by the current
separation between laboring and leisure classes.</p>

<p>

 He then asks what role the fine arts should play in the education of
children. Although every adult has certain standards of aesthetic
value, a danger exists that they will attempt to teach those standards
directly to children.  If this happens the values taught will be
merely conventional and verbal. Working standards depend on what the
individual has appreciated in concrete activity. If the individual has
been accustomed to ragtime music (a popular form at this time) then
his or her working standards will be fixed at that level.</p>

<p>
For Dewey, the scope of appreciation is as broad as that of education
itself. Habits are merely mechanical unless they are also tastes. The
imagination is needed for appreciation in <em>every</em> field. Thus
imaginative activity should not be limited to the world of fairy
tales, or even to that of fine art. It is dangerous to associate
imagination only with childish play and fancy, while excluding it from
goal-directed activity. Even laboratory activities are best seen as
dramatizations that may be appreciated aesthetically.</p>

<p>

 For Dewey, the sharp distinction commonly made between play and work is due mainly
to undesirable social conditions. Both involve ends, materials, and
processes. In play, the activity is its own end, although the activity
may include considerable looking ahead, whereas work involves a longer
course of activity with a greater demand for continuous attention
(Dewey 1915, p. 202&ndash;204). The human demand for play persists in the adult need
for recreation. Dewey sees art as meeting this demand. Play and work
are prior to the distinction between useful and fine arts. These
activities involve emotions, imagination, and skill, which are also
required for artistic production. They ground both useful and fine
arts, and this shows that the distinction between the two should not
be seen as rigid.</p>

<p>

 Dewey holds that appreciation is intensified valuing. The main
function of the fine arts is enhancement of qualities that make
ordinary experience appealing: they fix taste for later
experience. They also reveal meaning and supply vision. They
concentrate aspects of the good that are otherwise scattered. For
Dewey, there are no degrees of value apart from a particular
situation. Thus, if a man has been starving, and has had enough music
for now, he will judge food to be more valuable than music. The only
ultimate value is the process of living itself, This is the whole of
which the various studies and activities involved in education are
merely ingredients.</p>

<p>

 Dewey insists on not limiting aesthetics to art, or artistic to
aesthetic value. Arithmetic and science, as much as poetry, should
sometimes be appreciated aesthetically. Dewey believed that only when
art is sometimes appreciated for itself can it also be used for other
ends. The main value of fine art is not the enjoyment of leisure, but
heightening meaning through concentration.</p>


<h3>Experience and Nature</h3> 

<p>
Dewey begins to develop both an aesthetic theory and a theory of art
in his 1925 Paul Carus lectures, <em>Experience and Nature</em> (Dewey
1925a). However this needs to be teased out through close reading and
is not evident in chapter titles or even in the index. Early in the
book, he emphasizes the importance of direct enjoyment of song, dance
and story-telling in human experience, noting how even philosophers
who stress pleasure, such as utilitarians, have failed to address this
domain (p. 78). He observes that early humans were more interested in
direct satisfaction than in prudence. Thus bodies were decorated
first, and clothed later. Similarly, early men made a game of fishing
and hunting. In general, useful labor was transformed by ceremony into
enjoyable art. Although the activities of play and ritual were
intended to have practical effect, their aesthetic impact was even
more important.</p>

<p>

 Dewey uses these historical claims to support a broadening of the
field of aesthetics today. Although some would see popular fiction and
other sources of mass entertainment as a travesty of art, these, as
well as even more elementary things, such as jokes, beating drums, and
blowing whistles, have the same quality of immediate finality as
things generally called aesthetic.</p>

<p>

 A nascent aesthetic theory can be found in Dewey's fifth chapter,
&ldquo;Nature, Communication and Meaning.&rdquo; Here he presents an
aestheticized theory of language and of essences. The heart of
language is not expression of something that comes before. Rather, it
is participation in communication. Thus meaning is not private. In the
process of cooperative action through language the thing referred to
gains both meaning and heightened potential. Whereas animism refers
this to the immediate relation of thing and person, poetry gives it a
legitimate form. The potential of a thing is its essence, and to
perceive a thing is to acknowledge that potential. Essence, or
pronounced meaning, is the object of aesthetic intuition. Here,
feeling and understanding are one (Dewey 1925a, p. 183). The essence of a thing is
identified with the &ldquo;consummatory consequences&rdquo; and
emerges from the various meanings attributed to it.</p>

<p>

 In communication, then, things reveal themselves to men. Within human
experience all natural events are adapted to meet the needs of
conversation. The arts are forms of communication. Communication is
enjoyed for its own sake in dance, song and drama, where it is both
instrumental and final. Art is critical of life because it fixes
standards of enjoyment, and thus determines what <em>should</em> be
desired.  Moreover, the level of the arts in a community determines
its direction.</p>

<p>

 Dewey has the most to say about aesthetics in Chapter Nine,
&ldquo;Experience, Nature and Art.&rdquo; The structure of the
argument is unfortunately, vague when compared to his later
masterpiece, <em>Art as Experience</em> (1934). He begins with the Greeks who
saw experience as exemplified in technical skill, and hence as
equivalent to art, but who unfortunately downgraded experience when
compared to reason. For them, everything in experience, and in art,
was contingent. <em>Modern</em> thought sees art as simply an addition
to nature, although it eulogizes art&mdash;especially fine art. Like
the Greeks, it denigrates the practical, but it does so because it
considers it subjectively distorted.</p>

<p>

 Dewey has two main points in this chapter: that science is an art,
and that art is a &ldquo;practice.&rdquo; The only distinction between
modes of practice should be between those that are intelligent and
give immediate enjoyment through charged meaning, including fine art,
and those that do not (Dewey 1925a, p. 358). If this distinction was maintained art
would then be seen as the culmination of natural processes, and
&ldquo;science&rdquo; (improperly so called) as merely a helpful means
for achieving this end. The various dualisms of nature and experience,
art and science, and so forth, would disappear.</p>

<p>

 Dewey believed that art unifies the necessary and the free aspects of
nature, and thus that artistic acts are both inevitable and
spontaneous. Unexpected combination is required for art: order and
proportion are not the whole story. The more extensive the
uniformities of nature in art, the greater the art, as long as they
are fused with our wonder for the new.</p>

<p>

 Dewey reiterates that there is no real distinction between useful and
fine art. The merely useful is not really art, but routine. Also,
those arts that are only final are mere amusements. There are of
course activities, including much of what we call labor, that have no
immediate enjoyable meaning.  We <em>call</em> such activities useful,
but they are really detrimental to human well-being. Humans have a
great need to appreciate the meaning in things and this is hindered by
labor as it is structured in our society.</p>

<p>

 Dewey thinks that what is <em>generally</em> called fine art includes
self-indulgent self-expression without regard to communication,
experimentation in new techniques that produce bizarre products, and
production of commodities for the wealthy. <em>True</em> fine art
produces an object that gives us continuously renewed delight. A
genuine aesthetic object is not only something that gives consummatory
experience but also helps to produce further satisfaction.  Any
activity that does this, even if not found within the traditional list
of arts, is fine art.</p>

<p>

 Fine art is not just an end in itself: it improves apprehension,
enlarges vision, refines discrimination, and creates standards. Both
the artistic and the aesthetic involve perception in which the
instrumental and the consummatory intersect. Art gives us the object
replete with meaning. Aesthetic experience, unlike sensual
gratification, is informed with meaning. Artistic sense involves
grasping potentialities. And artists are gifted persons who integrate
focused and defined perception with skill in a progressive way.</p>

<p>

 For Dewey, both useful and fine arts involve interpenetration of
means and ends. Things are only called &ldquo;useful&rdquo; because
they are thought to belong to menial arts, or are related to common
people. Things called &ldquo;fine&rdquo; are often decorative or
ostentatious. One might think that things are merely useful when
perception of meaning is incidental.  However, this may not be
helpful, for in art perception is always used for something beyond
itself. Moreover, such useful things as pots may be intrinsically
enjoyable. The basic distinction is between good and bad art: good art
requires interpenetration of fulfillment and usefulness, and bad art
fails in this. </p>

<p>

 Dewey holds that thinking itself is an art. Propositions that express
knowledge are as much works of art as statues and
symphonies. Conclusions are matters of condensed meaning, while
premises result from analysis of conclusions into their
grounds. Scientific method is the art of constructing true
perceptions. Science is not seen as art in our society because it is
artificially protected, is limited to a particular class of persons,
and is seen as brutal and mechanical. This is coupled with the view
that criticism a pedantic expression of merely personal taste. Dewey
believes that this dichotomy needs to be overcome, and that to do this
we need discriminating judgment.</p>

<p>

 Dewey rejects the theory that art is a mere medium for emotion. This
does not mean he believes that emotion is irrelevant to art. Emotion
is evoked by objects, and is a response to an objective situation. The
origin of artistic creation is in emotional response to a situation.
Contrary to Clive Bell (1914), he holds that
significant form can only refer to forms that give significance to
everyday subject-matters. Art does not create these forms. The forms
that give us pleasure do so because of their structure. Dewey was not
anti-formalist, however. Although formalist art-works can be sterile
or pedantic, they may also enlarge and enrich our world by way of
training our perception.</p>

<p>

 The following and final chapter, &ldquo;Existence, Value and
Criticism,&rdquo; develops Dewey's theory of criticism. There, he
argues against putting values in a separate realm from nature, and
against understanding nature in simply mechanistic terms. Instead, he
advises a return to Greek concepts of potentiality and actuality,
although without the Greek tendency to see natural ends as
perfections. He thinks it important to develop a theory of criticism
that would allow us to discriminate amongst goods. This theory would
not be limited to the arts. Criticism is also found in morals and in
religious belief. Philosophy, he argues, is a form of criticism too:
it is criticism of criticism.  Indeed, as soon as one begins to talk
about values, and to define them, one is doing criticism. Criticism
requires inquiry into the conditions and consequences of the object
valued. It is needed to enhance perception and to allow for
appreciation of the same thing over time. It accomplishes this by
uncovering new meanings.</p>

<p>

 Dewey insisted that criticism is not just a matter of formal
writings. It happens every day in every aspect of our
experience. Formal criticism simply develops the element of criticism
found in appreciation. Philosophy shows that there is no difference in
principle between scientific, moral and aesthetic appreciation. Each
involves a transition from natural goods to goods reflectively
validated.</p>

<p>

 Dewey rejects the idea that values, including aesthetic values, are
merely personal affairs. There is no consensus in aesthetic theories
because aesthetic phenomena have been segregated from other aspects of
life. Standards may be used to judge immediate goods, but standards
are just likings on the part of specific creatures, and it is
meaningless to ask which of them is stronger. Common sense tells us
that there are immediate goods <em>and</em> that there are principles
by which they may be judged. It does not accept a rigid separation of
knowledge and aesthetic appreciation. But it fails to see that system
is needed for adequate judgments. Aesthetic criticism allows us to
choose knowingly, for it reveals conditions and consequences, and it
allows our likings to be expressed in an informed way.</p>


<h3>Qualitative and Affective Thought</h3>

<p>
Dewey wrote two essays in the early 1930s, &ldquo;Qualitative
Thought,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Affective Thought,&rdquo; both included in
<em>Philosophy and Civilization</em> (Dewey 1931), which developed his
nascent aesthetics further. Much like the phenomenologists of his
time, Dewey held that the world in which we live is mainly a
qualitative world. The concept of &ldquo;pervasive quality&rdquo;
which is so central to <em>Art as Experience</em> is explicated
here. Dewey considered works of art to be particularly good
manifestations of pervasive quality. A painting that is a work of art
has a quality that separates it from other paintings and pervades it
in all details. The underlying pervasive quality also regulates both
the creative production and the appreciation of the work. Dewey's
concept of quality extends far beyond aesthetics. Generally,
situations are held together by a single quality. Since the situation
is metaphysically primary, objects and their relations can only be
explained by referring to it. The object of thought is a quality that
is directly and unreflectively had. The total pervasive quality is the
&ldquo;given.&rdquo; It is that to which all thought refers, and this
is true even though it is not directly present to thought.</p>

<p>

 Dewey also develops further his theory of evaluation. Evaluative
responses such as &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; can be symbols of our
attitude towards the quality of a situation. For example,
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; may indicate that we perceive the quality of a
performance on stage. Such pronouncements may reflect a judgment
better than lengthy writings. Some of them, when not immature, sum up
previous experience and bring to culmination a long process of
reflection. Such statements are not limited to the art expert's
appreciation of art, but are also found in science.</p>

<p>

 Dewey thinks that the refusal to admit that there is thought in
artistic construction is a failing of traditional logic. For something
to be a true work of art the parts must hang together, reinforcing
each other and the pervasive quality. Although analysis of works of
art often uses terms like symmetry and harmony, which may in turn be
formulated mathematically, it is not necessary for either the artist
or the viewer to perceive these relations. The underlying quality
demands distinctions, and this gives the work its necessity. We may
see a picture by Goya and recognize it instantly <em>as</em> by Goya
because of the quality it has as a whole. Although further analysis
may cause us to reject our initial recognition, that recognition is,
when appreciative, more dependable than analysis.</p>

<p>

 In &ldquo;Affective Thought,&rdquo; Dewey argues against separation
between physiological processes and high culture, between art and
science, and between thought and emotion. When these dualisms hold,
the resultant compartmentalization leaves little room for living life
for its own sake. Psychology shows that reasoning is not just
intellectual but is based on a play of intellectual and affective
activities.  When the organism's (e.g., a human's) relation to its
environment is disturbed it desires activity. The disturbance is only
resolved when the organism reaches a new equilibrium.  Reasoning is a
phase in this process. It finds material to satisfy needs in our
habits and in past experience. Ends are to be understood in terms of
the needs of the organism, <em>not</em> by referring to some higher
power. Although there are no deep differences between science and art,
the logic of art is especially characterized by subtlety and
scope. Art-viewers respond strongly to art because the generation of
art is guided by unconscious activities. Deep habits are used in new
ways, and this causes art to be liberating and expansive.</p>

<p>

 Dewey follows Barnes in holding that integration of the aesthetic
object (of which painting is the focus example) allows for integration
of the activities of the person perceiving it. Merely conventional
painting, by contrast, will eventually tire us out. Dewey holds that
Barnes has set forth an objective criterion of value in paintings
which will eventually allow for adequate psychological analysis of
aesthetic experience.  Following this path, appreciation will no
longer be merely private. Barnes has also shown that the history of
art must be based on what is distinctive to painting, i.e.,
color. Although more recent examples of using color to render action
has led to distortions disliked by many (think of Picasso), these will
eventually be accepted. Dewey believed that the fully harmonized
experience achieved by participants in Barnes Foundation activities
will set the standard for other experience and thus will counter the
various disruptions of our compartmentalized lives.</p>
