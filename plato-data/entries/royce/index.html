<div id="preamble">

<p>
Josiah Royce (1855&ndash;1916) was the leading American proponent of
absolute idealism, the metaphysical view (also maintained by G. W. F.
Hegel and F. H. Bradley) that all aspects of reality, including those
we experience as disconnected or contradictory, are ultimately unified
in the thought of a single all-encompassing consciousness. Royce also
made original contributions in ethics, philosophy of community,
philosophy of religion and logic. His major works include <em>The
Religious Aspect of Philosophy</em> (1885), <em>The World and the
Individual</em> (1899&ndash;1901), <em>The Philosophy of Loyalty</em>
(1908), and <em>The Problem of Christianity</em> (1913). Royce&rsquo;s
friendly but longstanding dispute with William James, known as
&ldquo;The Battle of the Absolute,&rdquo; deeply influenced both
philosophers&rsquo; thought. In his later works, Royce reconceived his
metaphysics as an &ldquo;absolute pragmatism&rdquo; grounded in
semiotics. This view dispenses with the Absolute Mind of previous
idealism and instead characterizes reality as a universe of ideas or
signs which occur in a process of being interpreted by an infinite
community of minds. These minds, and the community they constitute,
may themselves be understood as signs. Royce&rsquo;s ethics,
philosophy of community, philosophy of religion, and logic reflect
this metaphysical position. </p>

<h2><a name="Bio">1. Life</a></h2>

<p>
Royce was born November 20, 1855, in the remote mining town of Grass
Valley, California, to Josiah and Sarah Eleanor Bayliss Royce. Sarah
Royce was a devout Christian who headed a primary school in Grass
Valley. Royce&rsquo;s mother and older sisters directed his early
education. At age 11 he entered school in San Francisco. He graduated
from the newly established University of California in Oakland with a
B. A. degree in Classics in 1875. Royce then traveled to Germany to
study philosophy for one year, mastering the language and attending
lectures in Heidelberg, Leipzig, and G&ouml;ttingen. On his return, he
entered the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he
earned a Ph. D. in 1878.</p>

<p>
He taught composition and literature at the University of California,
Berkeley from 1878&ndash;1882. During this time he published numerous
philosophical articles, as well as his <em>Primer of Logical
Analysis</em>. He married Katherine Head in 1880. The couple had three
children (Christopher 1882; Edward 1886; Stephen 1889) and remained
married until Josiah&rsquo;s death. Not content in California, so far
from the intellectual life of the East Coast, Royce sought help in
attaining a new post from his acquaintances there. In his later
ethical writings Royce would stress the centrality of action intended
to realize a sound ideal that one has freely embraced. When offered
the opportunity to replace William James during a one year sabbatical
at Harvard University, Royce acted: he accepted the offer of half of
James&rsquo;s salary, resigned his California appointment altogether,
and moved his wife and newborn son across the continent in the summer
of 1882.</p>

<p>
In Cambridge, Royce commenced to work doggedly and in diverse areas.
In January 1883 he arrived at an insight that proved fundamental to
his philosophy: in order for our ordinary concepts of truth and error
to be meaningful, there must be an Absolute Knower, an actual infinite
mind that encompasses the totality of all actual truths and possible
errors. This insight formed the core of his first major philosophical
publication, The <em>Religious Aspect of Philosophy</em>, which
appeared in 1885. Royce received a permanent appointment as assistant
professor at Harvard in that same year. (During his three decades at
Harvard Royce would teach such notable students as T. S. Eliot, George
Santayana, and W. E. B. Du Bois.) He taught full time, gave many
public lectures, published his <em>History of California</em> in 1886,
and a novel in 1887. In 1888 he experienced a nervous breakdown, from
which he recovered after a sea voyage of some months&rsquo;
duration.</p>

<p>
Royce was appointed Professor of the History of Philosophy at Harvard
in 1892 and served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy from
1894&ndash;98. During these years Royce established himself as a
leading figure in American academic philosophy with his many reviews,
lectures and books, including <em>The Spirit of Modern Philosophy</em>
(1892) and <em>The Conception of God</em> (1895). In 1898 Royce
attended a series of lectures by Charles S. Peirce, &ldquo;Reasoning
and the Logic of Things,&rdquo; which significantly influenced his
understanding of the relation between logic and metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Royce delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of
Aberdeen in two series, the first in 1899 and the second the following
year. He regarded this as the opportunity to consolidate his years of
hard thought and study, so as to produce a definitive and original
statement of his metaphysics. The result was his two volume opus
<em>The World and the Individual</em> (1899&ndash;1901).</p>

<p>
The Gifford Lectures marked a turning point in Royce&rsquo;s life and
thought. He had worked out his philosophical theories in minute
detail. His public reputation as a philosopher was sealed (Royce was
elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1902
and of the American Philosophical Association in 1903). The year 1900
apparently represented the culmination of his life&rsquo;s work. Royce
was only 45 years old, though, and this culmination proved also to be
a starting point for significant growth.</p>

<p>
Reviews of <em>The World and the Individual</em> praised Royce&rsquo;s
philosophical acumen but raised significant objections to his
conclusions. Peirce, in particular, pointedly criticized Royce&rsquo;s
use of logic. Royce set out to reconsider his central arguments and,
at the same time, undertook an ambitious program of study in
mathematical logic. In his teaching and publications after 1900, two
philosophical strains came to the forefront. One was a growing
reliance on formal logical and mathematical concepts as the basis for
his metaphysical speculation (the first hint of this appears in the
&ldquo;Supplementary Essay&rdquo; to the first volume of <em>The World
and the Individual</em>). The second was an emphasis on philosophy as
a means to understand the concrete phenomena of life: the nature of
human society, of religious experience, of ethical action, of
suffering and the problem of evil.</p>

<p>
After 1907 Royce&rsquo;s emphasis on the relevance of philosophy for
living took on a clear personal dimension. In that year Christopher,
who had come with Josiah and Katherine across the continent as a
newborn 25 years earlier, and who had graduated from Harvard at age
18, showed symptoms of severe depression and psychotic delusions. In
1908 his parents committed him to a state mental hospital with little
hope that he would recover. In August of 1910 William James died,
leaving Royce without his closest friend, neighbor and colleague. In
September of the same year Christopher Royce died of typhoid fever,
leaving Josiah and Katherine without their firstborn child. Royce had
earlier stated his philosophy in a somewhat abstract and formal way,
so that it might help him discover metaphysical truth. Perhaps under
the weight of these later sorrows, Royce returned to his system
seeking wisdom and understanding in addition to truth.</p>

<p>
However that may be, and though he by no means abandoned systematic
and theoretical philosophy, Royce began to write more about what today
would be called &ldquo;practical&rdquo; or &ldquo;applied&rdquo;
philosophy. His major work on ethics, <em>The Philosophy of
Loyalty</em>, appeared in 1908. Later he would address ethics in even
more practical terms, not as a philosophy but as an &ldquo;art&rdquo;
of loyalty. He published a collection of essays under the title
<em>Race Questions, Provincialism, and Other American Problems</em> in
1908; another collection, entitled <em>William James and Other Essays
on the Philosophy of Life</em>, appeared in 1911. Four of the six
essays in <em>The Hope of the Great Community</em>, written in the
last year of his life and published posthumously in 1916, directly
concerned global politics and the Great War.</p>

<p>
Royce and James had always disagreed deeply concerning the proper
understanding of religious phenomena in human life. When James
delivered the Gifford Lectures in 1901 and 1902, he directed many
arguments against Royce&rsquo;s idealism, though he did not there
target his friend by name. James&rsquo;s lectures, published as
<em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>, were a popular and
academic success . Royce believed that James, who had never been
regularly affiliated with an established church or religious
community, had in that work placed too much emphasis on the
extraordinary religious experiences of extraordinary individuals.
Royce&rsquo;s first education was into a strongly Protestant world
view, he always retained a respect for the conventions of organized
Christianity, and his writings exhibit a consistent and deep
familiarity with Scripture. He sought a philosophy of religion that
could help one understand and explain the phenomena of ordinary
religious faith as experienced by communities of ordinary people.
There was a deeper difference between them, as well, and it centered
on a metaphysical point. Royce&rsquo;s 1883 insight concerning the
Absolute was at bottom a religious insight. Contrary to the open-ended
pluralism and pragmatism of James, Royce was convinced that the object
and source of religious experience was an actual, infinite, and
superhuman being. Royce did not attempt to work out his religious
philosophy until after James&rsquo;s death, however. In 1911 Royce
finally composed the lectures that responded to James. These were
published in 1912 as <em>The Sources of Religious Insight</em>. It is
here that the theoretical and practical threads of his late thought
began to come together. Royce himself said of the <em>Sources</em>:
&ldquo;It contains the whole of me in a brief compass&rdquo;
(Clendenning 1970, 570).</p>

<p>
In early 1912, Royce suffered a stroke. During his recovery, he
continued to explore the philosophy of religion outlined in the
<em>Sources</em>, with an eye toward adapting these ideas specifically
to Christianity. He also returned to Peirce&rsquo;s writings, seeking
the solution to certain nagging problems in his own metaphysics. He
found in Peirce&rsquo;s semeiotic, or theory of signs, the technical
tools he needed to address both issues at once. <em>The Problem of
Christianity</em> presents, in place of the earlier Absolute Knower,
the concept of an infinite community of interpretation guided by a
shared spirit of truth-seeking. This Universal Community, which
constitutes reality, develops greater understanding over time through
its members&rsquo; continual development of the meaning of signs.
Within this framework Royce endeavored to reconcile and explain many
key Christian doctrines and experiences.</p>

<p>
Though Royce lived only a few years beyond this late philosophical
breakthrough, his last period brought the true culmination and
flowering of his life&rsquo;s work. Besides <em>The Sources of
Religious Insight</em> and <em>The Problem of Christianity</em>,
notable available works include <em>The Hope of the Great
Community</em>, his last Harvard seminar on Metaphysics
(1915&ndash;16) and a series of lectures given at the University of
California at Berkeley. These lectures at his alma mater were to have
ended with a talk entitled &ldquo;The Spirit of the Community.&rdquo;
When the Great War broke out, Royce set this manuscript aside and
sketched a practical proposal to use the economic power of insurance
to mediate hostilities among nations and hence reduce the attraction
of war in the future. <em>War and Insurance</em> (1914) was a daring
political and economic proposal on behalf of the Universal
Community.</p>

<p>
Royce died on September 14, 1916. Though scholars now recognize the
originality and strength of his last works, he was unable to respond
to critics or to press his case for the last crucial innovations to
his philosophy. His reputation was eclipsed as other philosophers used
Royce&rsquo;s earlier writings as a foil in developing their own
doctrines of pragmatism, realism, empiricism, and logical analysis.
While scholars of American intellectual life have always acknowledged
the historical importance of Royce&rsquo;s influence, recent years
have brought a revival of interest in Royce&rsquo;s thought on its own
terms. Royce&rsquo;s work is proving especially fruitful for
theologians and philosophers interested in speculative philosophy and
metaphysics, practical and theoretical ethics, philosophy of religion,
and the philosophy of community.</p>

<h2><a name="Phil">2. Philosophy</a></h2>

<p>
Royce&rsquo;s early studies in Germany and at the Johns Hopkins
University concentrated on the development of post-Kantian idealism.
His philosophical work as a whole may be regarded as a committed
idealist&rsquo;s effort to understand the place of finite individuals
in an infinite universe, a theme that Royce captured most succinctly
in his Gifford Lectures title, &ldquo;The World and the
Individual.&rdquo; This theme will serve as a touchstone in the
following survey of Royce&rsquo;s work in metaphysics and
epistemology, ethics and practical philosophy, religious philosophy,
and logic.</p>

<h3><a name="Met">2.1 Metaphysics and Epistemology: Idealism and Interpretation</a></h3>

<p>
Royce announced the beginning of his professional career with a novel
defense of absolute idealism, &ldquo;the argument from error.&rdquo;
Kant had introduced the notion of a &ldquo;transcendental
argument&rdquo; by asking what the world must be like in order for
knowledge of the world to be possible. In <em>The Religious Aspect of
Philosophy</em> Royce took the experience of error &mdash; a
particularly compelling aspect of the phenomenon of knowing &mdash; as
the starting point for his own transcendental argument. According to
the correspondence theory of knowledge an idea (or judgment) is true
if it correctly represents its object; error obtains when an idea does
not correctly represent its object. It is indisputable that finite
minds do sometimes entertain erroneous ideas. Royce pointed out that
in such a case the mind must contain an (erroneous) idea and its
(false) object, while simultaneously intending, or &ldquo;pointing
toward,&rdquo; the idea&rsquo;s true object. If the mind is able to
intend the true object then that object is somehow available to the
mind. How can it be that the true object is in this way available to
the mind, but not known? Consider what happens in an ordinary example
of error: if I think that my keys are on the table, but later discover
that they are in my pocket, I do not conclude that my keys never
existed as the object of my thought. Rather, I focus on an idea that I
had all along &mdash; that my keys do definitely exist somewhere. The
keys, their location, and all other facts about them are the true
object of an idea. At the moment when I discover that my keys are not
on the table, it becomes apparent that this true object was only
imperfectly available to me. The fact that such error does occur
indicated to Royce that the true object of any idea must exist, in a
fully determinate or absolute state, in some actual mind with which my
own mind is or may be connected. From the possibility of error, Royce
concluded that there is an Absolute Knower, a mind for which all
thoughts do correspond correctly and adequately to their true
objects.</p>

<p>
One objection to the argument from error is that another type of
objective reality, some other sort of being external to one&rsquo;s
finite mind, might explain the possibility of error just as well.
Royce took up this objection in the first volume of <em>The World and
the Individual</em>, which was subtitled &ldquo;The Four Historical
Conceptions of Being.&rdquo; In this extended argument Royce critiqued
what he regarded as the main competing conceptions of objective
reality so as to strengthen his case for idealism. The first
conception of being Royce considered was <em>realism</em>, the view
that the world exists entirely independently of our thoughts or ideas
about it. The world is what it is, in short, without any reference to
our thoughts. While this view has great common-sense appeal and does
provide for an objectively existing sphere of being against which our
ideas can apparently be measured, Royce pointed out a fundamental
problem. Realism, so defined, introduces a radical metaphysical
dualism. Between my ideas, and a sphere of being that by definition
exists completely independent of those ideas, there is a gap that
cannot be bridged. Realism posits an objective realm that is utterly
independent and hence, strictly speaking, is utterly meaningless to
thought. The theory of <em>mysticism</em>, the second conception of
being Royce considers, likewise meets with problems. This view
maintains that the real is the ineffable immediate fact that is
present to the mind. Mysticism avoids the problem of an unbridgeable
gap between idea and reality by completely denying any such gap. The
difficulty here is that one cannot then distinguish between idea and
reality. If reality is in the end the immediate content of my idea,
then error in my idea of reality would simply appear to be impossible.
The third conception of being, which Royce identifies with Kantian
<em>critical rationalism</em>, is presented as a correct but
incomplete view. Royce characterizes critical rationalism as the view
that &ldquo;What is, gives warrant to ideas, makes them true, and
enables us to define determinate, or valid, possible
experiences&rdquo; (Royce 1976 [1899&ndash;1901], 266). The real is
that which, in conforming to given universal structures or categories
of experience, is capable of validating certain ideas. The connection
between my ideas and an objectively existing sphere of being is
clearly established: my ideas and that sphere both conform to the same
categories of experience. The independence of objective reality, and
hence the possibility of error, is likewise preserved: I may form an
idea of a definite possible experience (e.g., that my keys are on the
table) but then discover that reality does not validate my idea (I can
in fact check the table surface and discover that my keys are not
there). The critical rationalist conception is inadequate, in
Royce&rsquo;s view, because it is restricted to describing the
universal forms and possibilities of experienced reality. It cannot in
Royce&rsquo;s view account for the concrete, actual individual facts
that impose themselves in experience. These are simply and
mysteriously &ldquo;given&rdquo; in the critical rationalist
theory.</p>

Royce endeavored to extend and complete critical rationalism in his
explanation of the &ldquo;<em>fourth conception of being</em>.&rdquo;
To say that an idea intends its object means more than that the idea
may be validated by a &ldquo;possible experience.&rdquo; An idea in
this respect embodies a purpose: that its meaning shall be fulfilled
in experience. In Royce&rsquo;s view this requires a world that is
more than the abstract or merely hypothetical content posited by the
description of a possible experience. What is needed is a definite,
actual individual being that exists &ldquo;in an absolutely final
form.&rdquo; Royce thus agrees with critical rationalism in saying
that a true idea is one that may be fulfilled or validated by a
possible experience. He argues further, though, that such a possible
experience requires the existence of an actual being (e.g., the
particular set of keys in my pocket) that is in principle capable of
being experienced. It is this being, the actual individual, and not
the mere possible experience of it, that is the object of knowledge
and &ldquo;the essential nature of Being&rdquo; (Royce 1976
[1899&ndash;1901], 348). The &ldquo;fourth conception of being&rdquo;
detailed in <em>The World and the Individual</em> provides the
metaphysical background for the remainder of Royce&rsquo;s thought. It
presents a view of the totality of Being as an actual Infinite
Individual that is itself timeless, encompassing as it does all valid
past, present, and future possible experience of fact. All finite
beings, such as ourselves, are but fragments of this Absolute Mind or
eternal truth.</p>

<p>
In his last period Royce embraced what may be called a hermeneutic
epistemology. While he still maintained the central notion that a true
idea correctly represents its object, he arrived at a new
understanding of the nature of representation. Earlier, he had rather
uncritically taken &ldquo;representation&rdquo; to be a
straightforward correspondence relation in which the idea merely
copied its object. Under the influence of Peirce&rsquo;s theory of
signs, however, Royce came to appreciate the creative, synthetic, and
selective aspects of representation. The new semiotic conception is
detailed in the chapter of <em>The Problem of Christianity</em>
entitled &ldquo;Perception, Conception and Interpretation.&rdquo;
Knowledge is not at bottom merely the accurate and complete perception
of an object, as empiricism would have it. Nor is it the accurate and
complete conception of an idea, as rationalism maintains. Knowledge is
instead a process of interpretation: the true idea selects,
emphasizes, and re-presents those aspects of the object that will be
meaningfully fulfilled in subsequent experience. Royce&rsquo;s
&ldquo;absolute pragmatism,&rdquo; like other versions of pragmatism,
thus offers an alternative to rationalism and empiricism.</p>

<p>
This revised understanding of knowledge as interpretation prompted, if
it did not exactly require, a corresponding change in Royce&rsquo;s
notion of the Infinite Mind whose reality was established in the
argument from error. As long as knowledge is regarded as possessing
perceptions or conceptions that correspond to objects, the Infinite
Mind is naturally envisioned as something that &ldquo;contains&rdquo;
the totality of all perceptions or conceptions. If knowledge is
instead regarded as a process of interpretation, though, the Infinite
Mind may be regarded as the mind that carries this process forward.
Royce had long sought an explicitly non-Hegelian account of Absolute
Mind. In <em>The Problem of Christianity</em> he was finally able to
replace the old terminology of the Absolute with a description of an
infinite Community of Interpretation. This community is the totality
of all those minds capable of representing aspects of Being to one
another or to their future selves. Royce summarized the metaphysical
implications of this new view by saying &ldquo;the real world is the
Community of Interpretation&hellip; If the interpretation is a
reality, and if it truly interprets the whole of reality, then the
community reaches its goal [i.e., a complete representation of Being],
and the real world includes its own interpreter&rdquo; (Royce 2001
[1913], 339). In this late period Royce remained firmly committed to
idealism. He renounced the notion that the Absolute is complete at any
actual time, though, and instead preferred to think of the possible
totality of all truth simply as the eternal.</p>

<h3><a name="Log">2.2 Logic</a></h3>

<p>
Royce maintained an interest in logic throughout his career. His first
published book was a <em>Primer of Logical Analysis for the Use of
Composition Students</em>, written for his students in California in
1881. A long piece from 1899, entitled &ldquo;Supplementary Essay: The
One, the Many, and the Infinite&rdquo; and appended to the first
volume of <em>The World and the Individual</em>, marks his first
effort to support his philosophical theses using ideas explicitly
drawn from modern logic and mathematics. His own proposal for a system
of formal logic was published as &ldquo;The Relation of the Principles
of Logic to the Foundations of Geometry&rdquo; in 1905; this work was
extended in &ldquo;The Principles of Logic&rdquo; in 1914 (reprinted
in Robinson 1951, 379&ndash;441 and 310&ndash;378, respectively).
Among his last writings were a series of encyclopedia articles on
logical topics: &ldquo;Axiom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Error and Truth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;Negation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Order&rdquo;
(reprinted in Robinson 1951). Besides these and other published works
on logic, thousands of pages of his unpublished and largely unexplored
logical writings are among the Royce Papers at the Harvard University
Archives.</p>

<p>
It is clear that after <em>The World and the Individual</em> Royce was
ever more deeply interested in logic and mathematics. Precisely how
and to what extent his philosophical work was based upon logical and
mathematical concepts, or how his logical writings might clarify and
extend ideas developed in his other works, will require a much more
comprehensive examination and analysis of the logical writings than
has yet been undertaken. At this point, scholars interested in
Royce&rsquo;s logic may refer to the selection of original works
published in Robinson (1951) and to chapters 9 through 11 of Kucklick
(1985). Such a line of research appears promising, if only because of
the assessment by C. I. Lewis that Royce&rsquo;s system of formal
logic, conceived as a &ldquo;general science of order,&rdquo; may be
preferable, for some uses, to that developed by Bertrand Russell and
Alfred North Whitehead in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. (Lewis 1916,
419).</p>

<h3><a name="Eth">2.3 Ethics and Practical Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>
That Royce&rsquo;s metaphysical solution to the problem of error was
of broad relevance for the rest of his philosophy is clear: &ldquo;The
existence of error&hellip;must be explained as due to the same
conditions as those which make possible finite life, evil,
individuality, and conflict in general&rdquo; (Robinson 123). Error is
possible, according to Royce, only if there is an infinite being for
which all intended objects could be realized. This Being (whether
conceived as Absolute Mind or the infinite Community of
Interpretation) also makes individual human life comprehensible.
Royce&rsquo;s considerable attention to speculative metaphysics is
complemented by his concern for the practical implications of that
metaphysics. The infinite manifests itself in the realm of individual
beings bound within the constraints of time, space, and finitude.
Ethics and religion have their basis in this relation of the
individual to the infinite real world, a relation Royce characterized
in terms of loyalty.</p>

<h4><a name="Loy">2.3.1 The Philosophy of Loyalty</a></h4>

<p>
Near the end of <em>The Philosophy of Loyalty</em> Royce wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
Human life taken merely as it flows, viewed merely as it passes by in
time and is gone, is indeed a lost river of experience that plunges
down the mountains of youth and sinks in the deserts of age. Its
significance comes solely through its relations to the air and the
ocean and the great deeps of universal experience. For by such poor
figures I may, in passing, symbolize that really rational relation of
our personal experience to universal conscious
experience&hellip;.(Royce 1995 [1908], 179&ndash;80)
</blockquote>

<p>
Royce&rsquo;s ethics is rooted in his analysis of the conditions
necessary for an individual life to be meaningful. It is not enough
that one&rsquo;s actions merely conform to the strictures of
conventional morality &mdash; a trained animal might well fulfill such
minimal conditions of morality. To lead a morally significant life,
one&rsquo;s actions must express a self-consciously asserted will.
They must contribute toward realizing a plan of life, a plan that is
itself unified by some freely chosen aim. Such an aim and its
corresponding plan of life could not easily be created by an
individual out of the chaos of conflicting personal desires and
impulses that we all encounter. Rather, such aims and plans are found
already largely formed in social experience: we come to consciousness
in a world that proffers countless well-defined causes and programs
for their accomplishment. These programs extend through time and
require the contributions of many individuals for their advancement.
When one judges a cause to be worthwhile and freely embraces such a
program, several momentous things happen. The individual&rsquo;s will
is focused and defined in terms of the shared cause. The individual
becomes allied with a community of others who are also committed to
the same cause. Finally, a morally significant commitment to the cause
and to the community develops. This commitment is what Royce calls
&ldquo;loyalty.&rdquo; The moral life may be understood in terms of
the multiple loyalties that a person exhibits.</p>

<p>
Just as the truth value of an idea is a matter of whether its intended
object is fulfilled in reality, the moral value of actions is a matter
of whether they are loyal, whether they tend to fulfill the
community&rsquo;s intended aim. Loyalty is a necessary condition for
moral validity; defined narrowly, as Royce prefers, loyalty may even
be a sufficient condition for moral validity. Royce&rsquo;s narrow
definition of loyalty, of &ldquo;true loyalty,&rdquo; is intended to
rule out loyalty to morally evil causes and the communities that serve
them. Royce observes that the highest moral achievements throughout
history have involved individuals&rsquo; loyalty to ideals that
promote the formation and expansion of communities of loyalty. Many of
the worst deeds have also involved a high degree of loyalty, but this
loyalty is directed exclusively to a particular group and is expressed
in the destruction of the conditions for others&rsquo; loyal actions,
of those other persons, and even of one&rsquo;s own community and
cause. Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and
vicious or &ldquo;predatory&rdquo; loyalty as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
a cause is good, not only for me, but for mankind, in so far as it is
essentially a <em>loyalty to loyalty</em>, that is, an aid and a
furtherance of loyalty in my fellows. It is an evil cause in so far
as, despite the loyalty that it arouses in me, it is destructive of
loyalty in the world of my fellows. (Royce 1995 [1908], 56)
</blockquote>

<p>
While every community hopes for the accomplishment of its central
cause, and sees that cause&rsquo;s fulfillment as its highest
achievement, Royce places particularly high emphasis on the phenomenon
of loyalty to a lost cause. A lost cause is not in Royce&rsquo;s view
a hopeless cause, but rather one that cannot be fulfilled within the
actual lifetime of the community or any of its members. Many lost
causes are rightly lost, of course: Royce would have recognized the
Confederate States&rsquo; defense of slavery during the U.S. Civil War
as such a case. Besides such misguided causes, though, there are a
number of legitimate causes that are, by this definition,
&ldquo;lost&rdquo; simply in virtue of their scope and magnitude. Such
causes are not hopeless, however. It is precisely these causes that
establish ideals capable of evoking our highest hope and moral
commitment.</p>

<p>
Chief among these are the universal causes of the full attainment of
truth, the complete determination of the nature of reality through
inquiry and interpretation, and of the establishment of universal
loyalty to loyalty itself. In practice, the formula of &ldquo;loyalty
to loyalty&rdquo; demands that one&rsquo;s moral and intellectual
sphere become ever broader and remain critical at all levels. All the
communities we actually know, those we inhabit and identify with, are
finite and to some degree &ldquo;predatory&rdquo; in Royce&rsquo;s
sense. This is clearly true of small social cliques, isolated
intellectual communities, parochial religious groups, self-interested
unions and corporations, local political movements, and other such
groups. Roycean loyalty requires one to scrutinze the aims and actions
of such communities and to work to reform their disloyal aspects. The
philosophy of loyalty calls us first of all, then, to create and
embrace more cosmopolitan and inclusionary communities. It should be
clear that this is only the first important step of an infinite
process aimed at realizing the ideal of universal loyalty. Any actual
community, whether it be the United Nations or a bickering family,
will in fact fall short of perfect loyalty. When it does so, each must
answer to the same critical scrutiny and calls for reform. There is no
expectation that these high ideals of perfect loyalty, truth and
reality will ever be fully realized. These &ldquo;lost causes&rdquo;
are indispensible, in Royce&rsquo;s view, as the source of absolute
norms for any community and its members.</p>

<p>
Royce maintained that the logic of volition, pursued far enough,
compels us to embrace precisely these lost causes as our own. In the
course of his extended debate with James over the adequacy of
pragmatism as a doctrine, Royce came to accept many of James&rsquo;s
principles. One, inspired by James&rsquo;s well-known essay &ldquo;The
Will to Believe,&rdquo; is that any philosophical view is at bottom an
expression of individual volition. Given the fact of our existence in
the world, we must first decide how we are to approach that world, and
then develop our philosophical theories accordingly. A second
principle that Royce adopted is the pragmatist view of truth: truth is
the property possessed by those ideas that succeed in the long run.
Royce&rsquo;s main disagreements with pragmatism concern the way these
two principles are typically understood. Royce maintains that although
there are several possible attitudes of the will that one might adopt
toward the world (including Schopenhauer&rsquo;s &ldquo;will to
live&rdquo; and its opposite, resignation) only one &mdash; loyalty to
the ideal of an ultimate truth &mdash; is correct. The other possible
attitudes of the will are self-refuting. He accordingly refers to his
own position as &ldquo;Absolute Voluntarism&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913],
349). Royce offers a similar argument concerning the pragmatist notion
of truth (Royce 2001 [1913], 279). Explicitly adopting one of
Peirce&rsquo;s concepts, Royce argues that to define truth using any
conception of &ldquo;the long run&rdquo; &mdash; short of the ideal
end of inquiry &mdash; is self-refuting. Given the apparent finality
of this argument (which is, again, a variation of the Argument from
Error) Royce calls his position &ldquo;Absolute Pragmatism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Royce&rsquo;s philosophy of loyalty resembles existentialism in
certain respects. Notable among these are the notions that we come to
moral awareness in a world of already established aims and social
projects, that moral responsibility requires a self-conscious and
deliberate individual choice to embrace particular causes, and that
the highest forms of ethical conduct involve dedication and effort in
service of a cause that offers no promise of final success. Royce
differs from later existentialists such as Camus and Sartre, however,
in several important respects. Royce would not accept their notion
that human efforts are finally absurd, unfolding against a backdrop of
a meaningless and indifferent universe. On the contrary, Royce
maintains that the concepts of ultimate meaning and reality are
powerful and legitimate forces in our lives. With existentialism,
Royce recognizes the very real chasms that separate one person&rsquo;s
feelings, thoughts, and will from another: the experience of another
may be inscrutable. At the same time, though, he insists that we
acknowledge the equally important fact that in ordinary social life
minds frequently do work in concert. Groups of people often are
unified in feeling, thought, and will by something that transcends any
of the individuals present (Royce 2001 [1913], 239).</p>

<h4><a name="Com">2.3.2 Theory of Community</a></h4>

<p>
Royce was one of the first American philosophers to recognize the
important challenge of Nietzsche&rsquo;s moral vision, which
celebrates those individuals who seek to exercise their autonomous
will to a &ldquo;socially idealized&rdquo; power. Such heroic
individualism, also associated with Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
and William James, proves unsatisfactory in Royce&rsquo;s view (Royce
1995 [1908], 41). Their inspiring ethical visions are doomed to
ineffectiveness precisely because of their extreme individualism.
&ldquo;There is only one way to be an ethical individual. That is to
choose your cause, and then to serve it, as the Samurai his feudal
chief, as the ideal knight of romantic story his lady, &mdash; in the
spirit of all the loyal&rdquo; (Royce 1995 [1908], 47). These
particular examples are meant to illustrate the essentially social
character of loyalty in general: &ldquo;My life means nothing, either
theoretically or practically, unless I am a member of a
community&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 357).</p>

<p>
One of the more striking features of Royce&rsquo;s philosophy is its
emphasis on communities as being logically prior to individuals. As we
have seen, Royce considers the notions of truth and knowledge
unintelligible for the individual unless we posit an ultimate knower
of objective truth, the infinite community of minds. The notions of
personal identity and purpose are likewise unintelligible unless we
posit a community of persons that defines causes and establishes
social roles for those individuals to embrace. The concept of
community is thus central both to Royce&rsquo;s ethics and his
metaphysics. Not just any association or collection of individuals is
a community. Community can only exist where individual members are in
communication with one another so that there is, to some extent and in
some relevant respect, a congruence of feeling, thought, and will
among them. It is also necessary to consider the temporal dimensions
of community. &ldquo;A community constituted by the fact that each of
its members accepts as a part of his own individual life and self the
same <em>past</em> events that each of his fellow-members accepts, may
be called a <em>community of memory</em>.&rdquo; Similarly, &ldquo;A
community constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as
part of his own individual life and self, the same expected
<em>future</em> events that each of his fellows accepts, may be called
a <em>community of expectation</em> or&hellip;<em>a community of
hope</em>&rdquo; (PC 248). These common past and future events, which
all members hold as identical parts of their own lives, are the basis
of their loyalty to the community.</p>

<p>
As discussed in connection with Royce&rsquo;s ethical theory, some
communities are defined by true loyalty, or adherence to a cause that
harmonizes with the universal ideal of &ldquo;loyalty to
loyalty.&rdquo; He refers to such communities as &ldquo;genuine
communities&rdquo; or &ldquo;communities of grace.&rdquo; Other
communities are defined by a vicious or predatory loyalty. These
degenerate &ldquo;natural communities&rdquo; tend toward the
destruction of others&rsquo; causes and possibilities of loyalty.
Finally, beyond the actual communities that we directly encounter in
life there is the ideal &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo; of all those
who would be fully dedicated to the cause of loyalty, truth and
reality itself.</p>

<p>
Royce stresses that the sharing of individuals&rsquo; feelings,
thoughts, and wills that occurs in any community (including the
Beloved Community) should not be taken to imply a mystical blurring or
annihilation of personal identities. Individuals remain individuals,
but in forming a community they attain to a kind of second-order life
that extends beyond any of their individual lives. Where a number of
individuals&rsquo; loyalty to a cause is coordinated in community over
time, Royce speaks non-figuratively of a super-human personality at
work: a genuine community is united by a guiding or
&ldquo;interpreting spirit.&rdquo; The interpreting spirit may on
occasion be embodied by a single person such as a leader or other
exemplar, but this is not always the case.</p>

<h3><a name="Relig">2.4 Philosophy of Religion</a></h3>

<p>
Though his writings contain a great deal of insight that is relevant
for a strictly naturalistic philosophy, religious concerns figure
prominently from Royce&rsquo;s first major publication, <em>The
Religious Aspect of Philosophy</em>, to his last two, <em>The Sources
of Religious Insight</em> and <em>The Problem of Christianity</em>. As
has been indicated, the main focus of Royce&rsquo;s early work was
metaphysical. In <em>The World and the Individual</em> he plainly
identified the object of his inquiry as &ldquo;the Individual of
Individuals, namely the Absolute, or God himself&rdquo; (Royce
1899&ndash;1901, 1:40). Critics of Royce&rsquo;s early works admired
his metaphysical argumentation but found his conception of God
wanting. Peirce observed that the Absolute Mind bore little
resemblance to the God that people seek in churches &mdash; it is not
the kind of being anyone would worship. James objected that if all our
errors and sorrows are in fact reconciled in the Absolute, then finite
persons would seem to be exonerated from ultimate responsibility for
their actions: they might as well enjoy a lifelong &ldquo;moral
holiday.&rdquo; With <em>The Philosophy of Loyalty</em> Royce began to
devote more attention to the practical questions of ethics and the
philosophy of community. In his last works he drew upon the notion of
loyalty to explain the nature of religious experience in human
communities.</p>

<p>
Royce states that &ldquo;the central and essential postulate&rdquo; of
every religion is that &ldquo;man needs to be saved&rdquo; (Royce 2001
[1912], 8&ndash;9). Salvation is necessary because of a combination of
two factors. The first is &ldquo;the idea that there is some aim or
end of human life which is more important than all other aims.&rdquo;
The second is that &ldquo;man as he now is, or as he naturally is, is
in great danger of so missing this highest aim as to render his whole
life a senseless failure&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1912], 12). Salvation
comes in the form of guidance toward understanding and accomplishing
the highest aim of life, so far as we are able. Given the limitations
and fallibility of the human perspective, Royce maintains that this
guidance must come from some super-human or divine source. Religion is
the sphere of life in which finite human beings are able to get into
touch with this divine source of wisdom and guidance.</p>

<p>
In <em>The Sources of Religious Insight</em> Royce considers and
rejects several common conceptions of religion before making his case
for a religion of loyalty. His discussion of natural <em>social
life</em> as a source of religious insight may be read as a critique
of the &ldquo;Social Gospel&rdquo; movement. His consideration of
<em>reason</em> is notable not for its familiar observation that
reason is inadequate to religious knowledge, but for his pragmatist
critique of the adequacy of mere reason even for scientific knowledge.
Finally, his careful consideration and rejection of
<em>individualism</em> in religion is a direct critique of the
Jamesean view of religious experience. Royce employs his familiar
dialectical method to make his case for religious insight through
participation in the loyal community, the &ldquo;invisible
church&rdquo; guided by a divine spirit and devoted to the highest
ideals of goodness. In the <em>Sources</em> Royce offers a view of
religion as common experience. It is &ldquo;common&rdquo; both in the
sense that it does not primarily consist of the kind of extraordinary
experiences that James emphasized, and in the sense that it is a
fundamentally social rather than individual experience of reality.</p>

<h4><a name="Chr">2.4.1 Christianity</a></h4>

<p>
While the <em>Sources</em> concerns the nature of religious experience
in general, <em>The Problem of Christianity</em> focuses on the
question &ldquo;In what sense, if any, can the modern man consistently
be, in creed, a Christian?&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 62).
Royce&rsquo;s answer actually rejects the sort of static concepts and
beliefs usually implied by devotion to specific creeds, including
those identified with Christianity. While his view pivots on the
Christian notion of divine incarnation, it is not the incarnation of
God in Jesus but rather the incarnation of the Spirit in the living
church that Royce emphasizes: &ldquo;the Church, rather than the
person of the founder, ought to be viewed as the central idea of
Christianity&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 43). The Christian
church&rsquo;s primary importance, for Royce, is as a paradigm of
community. He regards the Pauline church as the best exemplar of a
graced community: at its best, the church strives to embody the
guiding Interpreter Spirit, so as to become a Universal Community of
Interpretation &ldquo;whose life comprises and unifies all the social
varieties and all the social communities which&hellip;we know to be
real&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 340). Doctrines and creeds may change;
the particular institutions that identify themselves as churches may
or may not actually be communities of grace. What matters in the end
is the process of interpretation &mdash; the process of communicating
and understanding one another in actual, imperfect, finite communities
of grace bound together by loyalty and striving toward the ultimate
and ideal Beloved Community.</p>

<p>
Royce is critical of many historical churches because they have in his
view lost sight of the spirit that ought to guide them. At the same
time he would identify grace at work in many communities that are not
self-consciously religious. He had great respect for non-Christian
religions, paying especially careful attention to Buddhism (Royce took
the trouble to learn Sanskrit, and <em>The Problem of
Christianity</em> includes a very sympathetic presentation of
Buddhism). In the end, however, Royce was a philosopher who worked
within the intellectual context of Western Christianity. He maintains
that only the Christian model of the loyal community successfully
combines the true spirit of universal interpretation with an
appreciation of the &ldquo;infinite worth&rdquo; of the individual as
a unique member of the ideal Beloved Community, the Kingdom of Heaven
(Royce 2001 [1913], 193).</p>

<h4><a name="Evil">2.4.2 The Problem of Evil</a></h4>

<p>
The problem of evil is a persistent theme throughout Royce&rsquo;s
writings. He struggled with tragedy in his personal life and sought to
understand it better through philosophy. As an idealist he also had to
struggle with evil as a problem of metaphysics. Idealism maintains
that all deeds and events are ultimately taken up and reconciled in a
final perspective. This seems to suggest that the evil, sorrow, and
pain that run through human life are illusory &mdash; or what seems
even less comprehensible, that our experience of suffering is somehow
good, that it is &ldquo;all for the best.&rdquo; While some idealists
have accepted these apparent implications of their metaphysics, Royce
maintained that evil is a real fact of the world. He insisted that we
confront evil <em>as</em> evil and not regard it as a means to attain
a preordained but inscrutable Divine purpose. He sought to understand
evil philosophically. In seeking that understanding he was not content
to explain it away or to salve its effects by appealing to a clever
theodicy.</p>

<p>
Royce embraced a theistic process metaphysics that recognizes evil as
a real force and suffering as an irreducible fact of experience. In
&ldquo;The Problem of Job&rdquo; Royce addressed the traditional
problem of evil: &ldquo;Grant Job&rsquo;s own presupposition that God
is a being other than this world, that he is its external creator and
ruler, and then all solutions fail. God is either then cruel or
helpless, as regards all finite ill of the sort that Job
endures.&rdquo; If we consider that God is not a separate being, then
&ldquo;When you suffer, <em>your sufferings are God&rsquo;s</em>
sufferings, not his external work, not his external penalty, not the
fruit of his neglect, but identically his own personal woe. In you God
himself suffers, precisely as you do, and has all your concern in
overcoming this grief.&rdquo; Grief is not &ldquo;a physical means to
an external end,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;a logically necessary and
eternal constituent of the divine life&rdquo; (McDermott 1969, 843).
Though Royce believed that events are collectively tending toward an
ultimate reconciliation in the eternal perspective of the Beloved
Community, they are not erased even in that ideal perspective. The
events of life (joyful and sorrowful alike) persist, both as
experiences of the individuals who undergo them and also as
God&rsquo;s own experiences.</p>

<p>
Royce does not seek to explain away or lessen the reality of evil: it
is in his view a brute fact of being, an inevitable result of the
world&rsquo;s existence in time. Given the fact of evil, the most
important question concerns how we finite beings ought to respond to
it. His answer is that we should adopt the attitude of loyalty to
goodness and truth, which as real forces in the world are the
metaphysical opposite of evil. The loyal member of a genuine community
confronts evil and wills to overcome it through the very fact of
loyalty to its opposite. Evil can never be eradicated &mdash; this is
another way of saying that loyalty to loyalty is a lost cause. Though
the <em>success</em> of this high cause lies in the unreachable
future, the <em>meaning</em> of our response is manifest in our
present lives.</p>

<p>
Royce&rsquo;s powerful and original explanation of the doctrine of
atonement in <em>The Problem of Christianity</em> details how the
loyal community can best respond to human evil. The highest kind of
transgression in an ethics of loyalty is treason, or the willful
betrayal of one&rsquo;s own cause and the community of people who
serve it. The traitor is one who has freely embraced a cause and
joined with a community of grace in service of that cause, but who
then culpably commits some act that undermines the cause and the
community. Such a betrayal is but one step away from moral suicide: it
threatens to destroy the network of purposes and concrete social
relationships that define the traitor&rsquo;s self (Royce 2001 [1913],
162). Atonement occurs when the traitor and the community are
reconciled, when they are both saved from the evil deed through some
act of the will.</p>

<p>
Royce finds traditional Christian accounts of atonement
unsatisfactory. They do not adequately explain how both the traitor
and the community are reconciled and saved in the human sphere. Much
less do they explain the mysterious details of how atonement
reconciles the sinner with God. The traitor who recognizes the
magnitude of what has been lost through the act of betrayal lives in a
state that Royce calls &ldquo;the hell of the irrevocable&rdquo;
(Royce 2001 [1913], 162). Royce seeks an explanation of atonement that
acknowledges the irrevocable nature of a deed that has been done, and
which changes everything for the sinner and the community that has
been harmed. &ldquo;Penal satisfaction&rdquo; theories of atonement
simply do not speak to the sinner&rsquo;s situation: to be told that
an angry God demands repayment or retribution for the betrayal, and
that this price has been paid (by the violent death of Jesus Christ,
or by any other sacrifice) does not repair the sinner&rsquo;s own
devastated moral universe. The sinner &ldquo;is dealing, not with the
&lsquo;angry God&rsquo; of a well-known theological tradition, but
with himself&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 170&ndash;71). Royce seeks a
theory that first makes sense of the immediate human aspect of
atonement. If one can be found, it may then be considered
theologically. A theory of &ldquo;penal satisfaction,&rdquo; which
claims to answer theological questions but remains meaningless or
mysterious in human terms, is simply unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>
The concrete human evil of treason is that the traitor&rsquo;s loyalty
to the cause, and with it the moral relations that bound the community
together, have been broken and cannot be restored to their previous
state. &ldquo;Moral theories&rdquo; of atonement account for change in
the traitor&rsquo;s person but fail to explain how the &ldquo;wounded
or shattered community&rdquo; can be repaired (Royce 2001 [1913],
175). Such theories, in Royce&rsquo;s account, explain that in
contemplating Christ&rsquo;s willing sacrifice of his own life for the
sake of the human community, the sinner experiences deep repentance
and develops a new capacity for love of the betrayed community. The
sinner&rsquo;s soul is purified and made better (Royce 2001 [1913],
172). Such a process may bring the sinner to realize the hellish
magnitude of irrevocable treason. Royce points out, though, that such
a process by itself does nothing to reconcile the sinner to the
community or to repair that community. Such reconciliation and healing
requires something more than a change in the individual&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>
This brings Royce to consider theories of atonement that center upon
the community&rsquo;s act of forgiveness. Forgiveness, as an act of
the community and not the sinner, is clearly essential to atonement.
Moreover, it involves a recognition of human frailty &mdash; not just
the moral frailty of the sinner in question, but that of all humans.
Forgiveness involves a recognition that anyone might commit such an
act, that the cause of perfect loyalty is a lost cause. Even when it
can occur, though, forgiveness does not restore the community to the
innocent state of harmony and &ldquo;unscarred love&rdquo; that
existed before the betrayal (Royce 2001 [1913], 177&ndash;78).
Atonement moves the community and the traitor beyond the irrevocable
deed of betrayal. This cannot be done by an act of forgiveness that
returns the community and its relations to the way things were before.
&ldquo;The way things were&rdquo; is irrevocably gone.</p>

<p>
In its human aspect atonement occurs through an interpretive act that
creates new relationships among the members, including the traitor,
together with a new understanding and fresh embracing of their
unifying cause. The act of atonement &ldquo;can only be accomplished
by the community, or on behalf of the community, through some
steadfastly loyal servant who acts, so to speak, as the incarnation of
the spirit of the community itself&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 180).
This person acts as a mediating third party between the traitor and
the betrayed community. Things are not made the same as they were
before through atonement, but are in an important respect made better
&mdash; precisely because of the unique circumstances created by the
original act of treason. Through the atoning act genuine community is
restored and all the individuals involved may emerge as wiser, more
resolved servants of their common cause. In this sense, Royce writes,
&ldquo;<em>The world, as transformed by this creative deed, is better
than it would have been had all else remained the same, but had that
deed of treason not been done at all</em>&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913],
180).</p>

<p>
Royce indicates that this insight about the human aspect of atonement
provides the basis for a theological understanding of the atonement
involved in Christ&rsquo;s teachings and death. He does not himself
articulate the details of a theological doctrine of atonement,
however. He states &ldquo;the central postulate&rdquo; of &ldquo;the
highest form of human spirituality&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;<em>No
baseness or cruelty of treason so deep or so tragic shall enter our
human world, but that loyal love shall be able in due time to oppose
to just that deed of treason its fitting deed of atonement</em>&rdquo;
(Royce 2001 [1913], 186). This postulate cannot be proved true, of
course, but human communities can assert it and act upon it as if it
were true. Christian doctrine, as Royce presents it, takes this same
postulate as &ldquo;a report concerning the supernatural works of
Christ&rdquo; (Royce 2001 [1913], 186). In <em>The Problem of
Christianity</em> Royce had set out to answer the question &ldquo;In
what sense, if any, can the modern man consistently be, in creed, a
Christian?&rdquo; One form of his answer, based on this theory of
atonement, is that communities can and should act upon the faith that,
through the spirit of genuine community, atonement is always possible
as a response to human sin and evil.</p>
