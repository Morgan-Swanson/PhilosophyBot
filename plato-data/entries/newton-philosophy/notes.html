<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Newton&rsquo;s Philosophy</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  Whewell was responding to
Samuel Taylor Coleridge's plea that the members of the British
Association stop calling themselves &ldquo;natural
philosophers,&rdquo; for the scope of their research had narrowed
considerably in recent years. For details, see Snyder 2011:
1&ndash;7. The first time that &ldquo;scientist&rdquo; was used in
print was a year later, when Whewell&mdash;in an anonymous
review&mdash;discussed the outcome of the British Association meeting
in his review of Mary Somerville's book, <em>On the Connexion of the
Physical Sciences</em>&mdash;Whewell 1834: 59. The word
&lsquo;science,&rsquo; which derives from the Latin term
&lsquo;scientia&rsquo; (meaning, roughly, knowledge), has been in
continuous use in numerous contexts since the fourteenth century, but
it did not obtain its modern meaning until the mid-to-late nineteenth
century. Thus the new meaning of &lsquo;science,&rsquo; referring to
the natural sciences specifically, arose roughly at the time that the
word &lsquo;scientist&rsquo; was coined (the Oxford English Dictionary
has the new meaning of &lsquo;science&rsquo; first appearing in
1867).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>  Two recent studies of the
discipline of natural philosophy are French and Cunningham 1996 and
Grant 2007. For an influential interpretation of Newton's work in
natural philosophy, see Stein 2002; see also Domski 2010, Ducheyne
2012, and Janiak 2008.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  This approach to
understanding Newton's work remains controversial among both
philosophers and historians of science: for instance, see the strong
criticisms of the approach in Cohen and Smith 2002: 1&ndash;4, 19, and
see also Rutherford's remarks (2006: 12&ndash;14).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  For recent accounts, see
Domski 2012, which contains details of Newton's connections to figures
such as Descartes, Spinoza, Wolff and Kant. For a broader perspective
on Newton's influence on the eighteenth century, see Snobelen
2009. Cohen 1956 provides a classic account of the fate of the
Newtonian method in America, focusing on Benjamin Franklin's work on
electricity.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  Surprisingly, Kant
declared that Rousseau was &ldquo;the Newton of the
mind&rdquo;&mdash;for discussion, see Neiman 1997.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>  A proposition expressing
a matter of fact cannot be known to be true without appeal to
experience because, unlike in the case of &ldquo;relations of
ideas,&rdquo; the negation of the proposition is not
contradictory. For discussion of Hume's relation to Newton, with
citations to the voluminous literature on that topic, see De Pierris
2012, and cf. Schliesser 2007, for a different approach.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>  Newton would have been
familiar with the discussion of substances in
Descartes, <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>, part I:
&sect;&sect;51&ndash;53, and with the discussion in the second replies
(AT VII: 161) Newton owned the 1656 Elzevier (Amsterdam) volume <i>
Renati Des-Cartes Opera Philosophica Editio Tertia </i>, which
contained the <i> Meditations </i> and all the objections and
replies.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>  See Hooke to Oldenburg,
15 Feb. 1671/2, Newton 1959&ndash;, vol. 1: 113. In recounting
Newton's theory, Hooke does mention the points about refrangibility
and heterogeneity, but he thinks that Newton's &ldquo;first
proposition&rdquo; is &ldquo;that light is a body&rdquo; and that
differently colored rays of light are in fact &ldquo;several sorts of
bodies.&rdquo; I take this to represent Hooke's interpretation of how
Newton can account for the data with the theory that light consists of
particles. As Newton knew, Hooke had already articulated his own
theory of colors and of light's nature as a wave in Observations IX
and X in his <em>Micrographia</em> (Hooke 1665).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  See Huygens
1888&ndash;1950, vol.  10: 602. Ignatius Pardies, another of Newton's
interlocutors, similarly found it difficult to differentiate the claim
about the corporeal nature of light from Newton's ideas concerning
refrangibility and heterogeneity. See his two letters to the Royal
Society concerning Newton's work, both of which are reprinted in
Newton 1978; cf. the discussion of Pardies in Sabra 1981: 264&ndash;7.
Like Newton, Pardies was especially interested in the Cartesian theory
of motion&mdash;see Pardies 1670, which Newton had in his personal
library (Harrison 1978: 210)&mdash;and this may have influenced his
views in optics.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  In his library, Newton
had a 1656 Amsterdam edition of Descartes' <em>Principles</em>, along
with a 1664 London edition of the <em>Meditations</em> (Harrison
1978). On Newton's relation to Descartes and to Cartesianism, see the
classic treatment in the chapter &ldquo;Newton and Descartes&rdquo; in
Koyr&eacute; 1965, and cf. Stein 2002.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  The text first
appeared, in a transcription of the original Latin and an English
translation, in Newton 1962, edited by the Halls. In the Halls'
judgment, the text is juvenile and probably originates in the period
from 1664 to 1668. In an influential interpretation, Betty Jo Teeter
Dobbs contends, in contrast, that the work is mature and was written
in late 1684 or early 1685, while Newton was preparing the first
edition of the <em>Principia</em>&mdash;see Dobbs 1991: 141&ndash;6,
where she also reviews various alternative opinions on the matter. In
a recent essay, Ruffner (2012) raises important doubts concerning
earlier interpretations, concluding that the text must have been
written before Halley's famous visit to Newton in 1684.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>  Stein presents this
interpretation of Newton's <em>Principia</em> in his classic essay,
Stein 1970, which was originally a lecture given in 1967.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  For details of More's
views, see the classic paper Gabbey 1982; for details on the Cartesian
context, see the discussion in Reid 2008; and, for further discussion
of the Descartes-More correspondence and its possible influence on
Newton, see Janiak 2010.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>  This may mean that for
Newton, two substances can be co-located: for discussion, see two
recent papers by Hylarie Kochiras: Kochiras 2009 and 2011.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>  In the Scholium, he
notes explicitly that absolute space is not perceptible (Newton 1999:
414), and in corollary five to the laws of motion (Newton 1999: 423),
he indicates that a system of bodies&mdash;for instance, on a ship's
deck&mdash;will have the same motions among themselves whether the
whole system is moving uniformly or is at rest. Hence he was perfectly
aware that true motion is difficult to detect if it is absolute
motion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>  Even in Newton's home
university, Cambridge, and alma mater, Trinity College, his works and
ideas did not displace those of the Cartesians within the standard
curriculum until roughly 1700; indeed, Cartesianism was so popular
that the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, Edmund Boldero,
decreed in November 1688 that undergraduates could no longer base
their disputations on Descartes, but had to use Aristotle
instead&mdash;see Gascoigne 1985: 54&ndash;5 and 143&ndash;45.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>  Although astronomers
for centuries had thought that the planetary orbits must be circular,
for various important reasons, in the early seventeenth century Kepler had
argued that they are in fact elliptical (although this is consistent
with the idea, which became important in later contexts, that the
orbits are <em>nearly</em> circular). This innovation proved to be
crucial for later work in celestial mechanics. Ellipses are figures in
which a straight line from the center to any arbitrary point on the
surface does not describe a single radius that is equal in length to
all other radii.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>  See the
&ldquo;<em>Lectiones opticae</em>&rdquo; of 1670 in Newton 1984,
vol. 1: 86&ndash;7.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>  We owe this
translation of the phrase to Alexandre Koyr&eacute;, who first noted that
Newton uses the word &ldquo;feign&rdquo; in a parallel discussion in
English in 1957: 229 and 299 n. 12.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>  For an influential
discussion of the development in Newton's conception of hypotheses
over time, see Cohen 1966; see also the discussion in Ducheyne 2012:
58<em>ff</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>  See
the <em>Tentamen</em> in Leibniz 1849, vol. 6: 149, and also Bertoloni
Meli 1993: 128&ndash;9.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>  Despite its
importance, scholars still struggle with the proper characterization
of the mechanical philosophy&mdash;see Garber and Roux (2012) for a
recent series of papers on this topic. McGuire's classic paper (1972)
indicates the complexities in mechanist thinking in the seventeenth
century. As for Newton, some deny that he accepted the mechanical
philosophy (Janiak 2008), but others argue that if properly
characterized, Newton should be understood as a mechanist (Machamer,
McGuire, &amp; Kochiras 2012).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>  This is a potentially
confusing way of referring to the mass&mdash;specifically, what we
would call the inertial mass&mdash;of a body. See Definition Three in
the <em>Principia</em> (Newton 1999: 404&ndash;5).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>  By his
&ldquo;readers&rdquo; here, Newton apparently means the readers of
the <em>Principia</em>, which had been published six years earlier,
rather than Bentley, who would have been the &ldquo;reader&rdquo; of
this letter.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>  One of the most
influential accounts is in Henry 1994. In recent years there has been
a robust debate about the correspondence with Bentley in particular,
and about Newton's attitude toward action at a distance in general,
with many interpreters criticizing the account in Janiak 2008,
according to which Newton rejects the possibility of action at a
distance in very strong terms. See, e.g., Ducheyne 2011, Henry 2011,
and Schliesser 2011. Cf. Janiak's reply to their criticisms in 2013, 
and Henry's retort in 2014 forthcoming.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>  This view has been a
central aspect of twentieth-century scholarship on Kant, and seems to
be a common theme across various interpretive traditions. For
instance, despite their obvious philosophical and fundamental
political differences (Friedman 2000), both Cassirer and Heidegger
highlight Newton's influence on Kant's critical philosophy in
particular (Cassirer 1911: vol. 2: 600 and Heidegger 1962:
52&ndash;63, 65&ndash;6, 68&ndash;71).</p>
