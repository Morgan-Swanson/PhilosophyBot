<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Inverted Qualia</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 For example, in
<em>Purple Haze</em> (2001) Levine clearly assumes that experiences can
have both \(Q_{R}\) and
\(Q_{G}\)&mdash;can be both
&ldquo;reddish&rdquo; and &ldquo;greenish&rdquo;, in his terminology
(see, e.g., 102, 111).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
For the view that an extensive range of states/events have qualia, see
Horgan and Tienson 2002; for the view that episodes of conscious
thought have qualia, see Strawson 1994, Ch. 1.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 Notice that a
subject \(S\) may undergo an experience with
\(Q_{R}\) even if there is no object that looks
red to \(S\). For example, a visual hallucination of a ripe tomato
has \(Q_{R}\), as does the having of a red
afterimage. (At least, this is the usual way qualia terminology like
&lsquo;\(Q_{R}\)&rsquo; is understood.) So, if the
identification of \(Q_{R}\) with the property of
being an experience of something&rsquo;s looking red is to be sustained, it
must be possible for \(S\) to undergo &ldquo;an experience of
something&rsquo;s looking red&rdquo; even though there is no object that
looks red to \(S\). This might be thought unproblematic, but
&ldquo;disjunctivism&rdquo; about perception raises some complications.
According to disjunctivists, a hallucination of a ripe tomato and a
phenomenologically matching veridical experience of a ripe tomato are
not events of a common mental kind. Hence, if &ldquo;an experience of
something&rsquo;s looking red&rdquo; is supposed to be a distinctive kind of
mental event, then disjunctivists will deny that one can undergo an
experience of something&rsquo;s looking red when there is no object that
looks red. Relatedly, disjunctivists will deny that events/states with
\(Q_{R}\) thereby have something mental in
common, which is tantamount to saying that
\(Q_{R}\) is not a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; mental
property (in the sense of Lewis 1986, 60&ndash;1). See the entry on
 <a href="../perception-disjunctive/">the disjunctive theory of perception</a>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 Of course, it
might be objected that the explanation of qualia terminology just given
is too vague, and so fails to convey a unique meaning. For the
expository purposes of this article it will be assumed (not
uncontroversially) that this objection is mistaken. The explanation
will be disputed on other grounds by a proponent of the
&ldquo;Frege-Schlick&rdquo; view (see subsection 2.3.2); another
complaint against the explanation is discussed in subsection 3.8.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 In fact, this is
also the opening characterization of qualia in Dennett 1988
(&ldquo;&lsquo;Qualia&rsquo; is an unfamiliar term for something that
could not be more familiar to each of us: the <em>ways things seem to
us</em>&rdquo; (1988, 226)).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 Crane 2000,
177&ndash;8, points out that C. S. Pierce used qualia
&ldquo;in something like its modern sense&rdquo; in 1866.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 For other uses of
&lsquo;qualia&rsquo;, see Lycan 1996, 176&ndash;7, and Crane 2000.</p>

 <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 There are other
color spaces besides the NCS, one of which (the Munsell space) is
mentioned below; different spaces have different advantages and
limitations. Some spaces that are sometimes called &lsquo;color
spaces&rsquo; are in fact spaces of a narrow range of physically
characterized stimuli (e.g., lights), rather than a space of colors. It
should not be assumed without argument that exactly one of the many
genuine color spaces is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; color space; Westphal
1991, 118&ndash;22, and Hardin 1999b have some some relevant cautionary
remarks. For a brief introduction to color spaces, see Hardin 1993,
113&ndash;20, and Kaiser and Boynton 1996, 492&ndash;8; Kuehni 2003 is a
comprehensive survey.</p>

 <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 An early
appearance of the phrase &lsquo;inverted spectrum&rsquo; is in Block
and Fodor 1972. For &lsquo;spectrum inversion&rsquo;, see Shoemaker
1975a, b. Lewis 1929 invites us to &ldquo;[s]uppose that in the matter
of immediate sense qualities my whole spectrum should be exactly the
reverse of yours&rdquo; (75).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 On typical
versions of the relativist view discussed in subsection 3.5, if
overnight we all underwent the simple sort of spectrum inversion just
described, then this would &ldquo;invert the colors&rdquo; in the
following metalinguistic sense: after the change, the word
&lsquo;red&rsquo; would correctly apply to emeralds (etc.), and the
word &lsquo;green&rsquo; would correctly apply to rubies (etc.).</p>

<p>

1994, Ch. 1; Jacovides 1999.</p>

 This choice
and number of dimensions is not unproblematic. For discussion and
references, see Mausfeld 2003.</p>

 <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 Note that a
&ldquo;behaviorally detectable&rdquo; inversion scenario is merely one
in which the inversion is &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; detectable. In
such a scenario, subjects who are inverted with respect to each other
differ in relevant behavioral dispositions (e.g., dispositions to apply
color terms, dispositions to sort colored chips, etc.). But these
differences might be extremely subtle. If red-green inversion is
behaviorally detectable in the sense used in this article, it does
<em>not</em> follow that we can know whether or not it occurs.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
Harrison (1967, 1973) first raised this sort of problem for
behaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion. See also Clark 1985;
1993, 199&ndash;205; Casati 1990; Hardin 1993, 139&ndash;42; 1997; 1999a; Kay
1999; MacLaury 1999; Palmer 1999b, 984; Campbell 2000; and Broackes
2007.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>  Shoemaker credits the
point to Taylor 1966. For other attempts to argue that a behaviorally
undetectable interpersonal inversion scenario is coherent, see Gert
1965, Lycan 1973, and Harvey 1979. For Wittgensteinian responses see
Canfield 2009 (a reply to Block 2007), and Brenner 2015.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
Block credits the example to Harman 1982.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 Suppose, in addition to a chromatic inversion, that black objects on
Earth are white on Inverted Earth and vice versa&mdash;so the
(blackish) blueberries in the center of the melon (figure 6, top left)
are white on Inverted Earth. A photograph of the inverted scene of
fruits would
<em>not</em> look like either the bottom left or right parts of figure
6, which is why Block specifies only a chromatic inversion. Setting
aside the fact that the white blueberries would look more distinct (and
not luminous), the space in shadow between the pepper, the banana, and
the lime would look black, and the specular (&ldquo;mirror-like&rdquo;)
highlights (see, for instance, the red pepper on the left) would look
white. For discussion of other problems with a black-white inversion
on Inverted Earth, see Broackes 2007.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 Block&rsquo;s
official description of Inverted Earth (&ldquo;fire hydrants are
green&rdquo;, etc.) raises complications. Return to the description of
the inverted qualia scenario in subsection 2.1, and in particular to
scene \(S\) as depicted in the left-hand part of figure 4. Suppose
an &ldquo;inverted scene&rdquo; \(S_{I}^*\) is
created as follows: if an object in the old scene has hue \(h\),
in \(S_{I}^*\) the object has \(I
(h)\) (compare the recipe given in subsection 2.1, in terms of
<em>apparent</em> hues). Take Invert as described in subsection 2.1: is
her experience when she looks at \(S\) phenomenologically the same
as yours when you look at \(S_{I}^*\)? Not
necessarily. Even with the stipulation that the illumination and
viewing position are exactly the same in \(S\) and
\(S_{I}^*\), the situation is underdescribed.
Suppose that: (i) \(y\) and \(b\) are, respectively,
determinate shades of yellow and blue; (ii) a banana in the original
scene \(S\) looks to you to have \(y\); and (iii)
\(I(y) = b\). So the banana in
\(S_{I}^*\) will have hue \(b\). If your
experience when looking at \(S_{I}^*\) is
phenomenologically the same as Invert&rsquo;s when she looks at \(S\),
the banana in the new scene must look to you to have hue \(b\).
But for a variety of reasons this is not guaranteed by the fact that
the banana has hue \(b\), that you have &ldquo;normal&rdquo; color
vision, and that the lighting is (as we may assume)
&ldquo;standard&rdquo;. For example, variation within the class of
those with normal color vision (see subsection 2.4 below), or variation
within the class of standard illuminants (different kinds of daylight,
say), can by themselves account for a difference in color
appearance.</p>

<p>

Further problems are posed by contrast effects (Hardin 1993, Ch. 1),
and &ldquo;interreflections&rdquo;&mdash;illumination reflected from
one colored object that is incident on another and then reflected into
the eye. In addition, if on Inverted Earth you see an Earth-style
variety of scenes in an Earth-style variety of illuminants, then you
would soon notice a difference. For example, green objects in reddish
light tend to look darker, so in reddish light green peppers (say)
would look darker on Inverted Earth than their red counterparts would
look in similar conditions on Earth (see Myin 2001, 69&ndash;70). This is
relevant to Block&rsquo;s argument against functionalism, but it might not
matter much for his argument against representationalism.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 It has been
suggested that, due to the genetic basis of certain color vision
deficiencies, there will be (rare) actual cases of red-green inversion
(Piantanida 1974); that now seems unlikely (for references and
discussion, see Byrne and Hilbert 2003a, 19). Still, the mere fact that
this possibility was taken seriously by vision scientists should give
some philosophers pause for thought (see Nida-R&uuml;melin 1996).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 A spectral
light is one composed of a very narrow band of wavelengths from the
visible spectrum, which runs from approximately 400nm to 700nm.</p>

attention to creatures found in worlds with the same basic laws as

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 Invert and
Nonvert do not need to be behavioral duplicates <em>simpliciter</em>
&mdash; just duplicates with respect to the behavioral dispositions
that are supposed to determine that one has an experience with
\(Q_{R}\). Similar remarks go for Arguments Ab
and Ac below.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 (a) and (b)
hold just as much for &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo;) functionalists as for
&ldquo;psychofunctionalists&rdquo; (for the distinction, see Block
1980, 1996b).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
 For attempts to remove the separation between conceptual coherence and possibility, 
 see Chalmers 1996, 131&ndash;4, and Jackson 1998; see also Section 5 of the entry on
 <a href="../zombies/">zombies</a>
 (&ldquo;Does conceivability entail possibility?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
 The actual
quotation has &lsquo;the intentional content of looking red&rsquo; in
place of &lsquo;\(Q_{R}\)&rsquo;, and expresses a thesis that
Block accepts: &ldquo;my brand of qualia-realism is
quasi-<em>functional</em>; here is why it is <em>quasi</em>-functional:
the <em>qualitative</em> content of experience [i.e., qualia like
\(Q_{R}\)] is <em>not</em> functionally
characterizable&rdquo; (1990, 58). See the following subsection.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>
 Discussions
of inverted spectrum arguments against functionalism include: Shoemaker
1975a, 1984; Block 1980, 1990; Lewis 1980; Putnam 1981, 79&ndash;82; Horgan
1984; Johnsen 1986; Levine 1988; Cole 1990; Harman 1990; Lycan 1987,
59&ndash;61, 1996, 118&ndash;121; Rey 1992; Chalmers 1996, 263&ndash;6; Carruthers 2000,
76&ndash;87; and Thau 2002, 17&ndash;21.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a>
 P1c is an
instance of Peacocke&rsquo;s &ldquo;most extreme form of the inverted
spectrum hypothesis&hellip;[that] asserts that another subject&rsquo;s visual
experience can be qualitatively different from your own when you are
both seeing the same object, even though your relevant brain states are
physically identical and so are your environmental
conditions&rdquo; (1988, 464). Peacocke argues, on grounds connected
with the individuation of thoughts, that &ldquo;the hypothesis of
extreme inversion is spurious&rdquo;(464). For a reply, see Johnsen
1993. Schoettle argues that "a person can be physically identical on two occasions (and in a physically identical environment) and yet the representational content of the person&rsquo;s perceptions of color can be different on the two occasions" (2009, 111&ndash;2), which he takes to support the positivist view that "philosophical questions about what constitutes the identity of our experience of color are cognitively meaningless" (113).</p>

2002, 450&ndash;2; Lycan 1996, 77&ndash;82; Byrne and Hilbert 1997b, 267&ndash;72; Rey
1998; Carruthers 2000, 109&ndash;112; Cohen 2001; Thau 2002, 21&ndash;35; Chalmers
2004; Macpherson 2005; Marcus 2006; Thompson 2008; Speaks 2011; and Ford 2011.</p>

 For an
argument that it should be classified as a form of representationalism,
see Byrne 2001, 224&ndash;7. Nothing will turn on this here.</p>

 This
difficulty for the orthodox phenomenist is related to the &ldquo;many
property objection&rdquo; to adverbialism (Jackson 1977, Ch. 3). See
also Clark 2000, Ch. 2.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a>
 This
terminology is from Shoemaker 2002; in Shoemaker 1994a, b, these are
called <em>phenomenal properties</em>.</p>

 On another
view, the propositional content of belief is a set of possible worlds
(see Lewis 1986 and Stalnaker 1987).</p>

 For criticisms of relativism, see Byrne and Hilbert 2003b, 57&ndash;8, and Hardin
2003.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a>
 A related
issue concerns the experiences of people with various defects of color
vision (see, e.g., Mollon et al. 2003), which unfortunately is a topic
largely unexamined by philosophers.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a>
 Compare
Palmer&rsquo;s thesis that &ldquo;Objective behavioral methods can determine
the nature of experiences up to, but not beyond, the criterion of
isomorphism&rdquo;(1999a, 934), by which he means (roughly) that
science can discover the relations between qualia but not their
intrinsic nature. (A related view is the &ldquo;structural
realism&rdquo; of Russell 1927.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a>
 Tye (1994, 177&ndash;8) denies P1.</p>

 One reply to
this objection links <em>understanding</em> &lsquo;Q\(_{R}\)&rsquo; with
<em>knowing that</em> &lsquo;Q\(_{R}\)&rsquo; refers to
\(Q_{R}\), and then appeals to the skeptical
argument of subsection 3.6 to argue that we have no such knowledge, and
so no such understanding. For more on ineffability and the inverted
spectrum, see Lewis 1929, 74&ndash;6; Gert 1965; Taylor 1966; Strawson
1989; and Block 2007. Related discussions of ineffability are in Lycan 1996, 9, 11,
101&ndash;8; Byrne 2002; Thau 2002, Ch. 5; and Hellie 2004. See also the 
entry on <a href="../private-language/">private language</a>.</p>

 <a href="index.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a>
 This conforms
to the official account of &ldquo;representational properties&rdquo; in
Chalmers 2004; for convenience in subsection 3.2 representational
properties were taken to be properties of mental events/states, not
subjects.</p>
