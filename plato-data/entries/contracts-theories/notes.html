<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Theories of the Common Law of Contracts</a></h2>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a> Note that although
this definition of offer invokes intentions to assume obligations, the
contemplated obligations need not, under U.S. American law, be
specifically legal. Thus the Restatement adds that</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Neither real not apparent intention that a promise
be legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract, but a
manifestation of intention that a promise shall not affect legal
relations may prevent the formation of a contract. (R2 Contracts:
&sect;21)</p></blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a> An early and
prominent account is Kant&rsquo;s, see <em>The Metaphysics of
Morals</em> (1797 [1996]: 6:271, p. 57). More recent elaborations of
variants of the will theory include Charles Fried, <em>Contract as
Promise</em> (1981), Randy Barnett, &ldquo;A Consent Theory of
Contract&rdquo; (1986), and Jody Kraus, <em>The Correspondence of
Contract and Promise</em> (2009). An unconventional variant appears in
Dori Kimel, <em>From Promise to Contract: Towards a Liberal Theory of
Contract</em> (2003).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a> As the Restatement
says, expectation damages &ldquo;put [the promisee] in as good a
position as he would have been in had the contract been performed,
that is, had there been no breach.&rdquo; (R2 Contracts: &sect;344
cmt. a).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a> The precise content
of fiduciary loyalty varies across fiduciary contexts. For a general
account see Ernest Weinrib 1975.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a> See, e.g., <em>200
North Gilmor, LLC v. Capital One, National Association</em> 2012:
</p>

<blockquote><p> A &ldquo;negligent misrepresentation claim based
on statements promissory or predictive in nature&rdquo; is not viable
&ldquo;[u]nless the plaintiff puts forward evidence tending to show
that the &lsquo;promisor&rsquo; or &lsquo;predictor&rsquo; made the
statements with the present intention not to
perform&hellip;.&rdquo;. But, a promise made with the present
intention not to perform is perforce, an intentional
misrepresentation, not a negligent one, and thus cannot sustain an
action for negligent misrepresentation. Put another way, [i]n order
for a negligent misrepresentation claim based upon a promise of future
conduct to be actionable, the party making the representation
regarding its future conduct must know, at the time it makes the
representation, that it does not intend to carry out the
promise. (citations omitted).</p></blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a> In a characteristic
case, a firm&rsquo;s board of directors offered a long-time employee a
pension payable whenever she elected to retire. The employee accepted
the offer, worked for a time, and then retired, whereupon a new
management refused to pay the pension. No obligation arose on the
model of orthodox contract, as the pension-promise was not made to
induce retirement (and announced on its face that retirement was just
the means of taking up the pension, to be adopted at the
employee&rsquo;s discretion whenever she chose). Nevertheless, a fully
formed promise (involving offer and acceptance) existed, and the
management making the promise clearly intended it to be legally
binding. A court thus employed Restatement &sect;90 to hold that
promise binding and require employer to pay the promised pension.
See <em>Feinberg v. Pfeiffer co.</em>, (1959).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a> Scanlon calls these
principles against manipulation and in favor of due care M and D.
Principle M states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the absence of special justification, it is not permissible
  for one person, <i>A</i>, in order to get another person, <i>B</i>,
  to do some act, <i>X</i> (which <i>A</i> wants <i>B</i> to do and
  which <i>B</i> is morally free to do or not do but would otherwise
  not do), to lead <i>B</i> to expect that if he or she does <i>X</i>
  then <i>A</i> will do <i>Y</i> (which <i>B</i> wants but believes
  that <i>A</i> will otherwise not do), when in fact <i>A</i> has no
  intention of doing <i>Y</i> if <i>B</i> does <i>X</i>, and <i>A</i>
  can reasonably foresee that <i>B</i> will suffer significant loss if
  he or she does <i>X</i> and <i>A</i> does not reciprocate by
  doing <i>Y</i>. (Scanlon 1998: 298)</p></blockquote>

<p>Principle D states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One must exercise due care not to lead others to form reasonable
but false expectations about what one will do when one has good reason
to believe that they would suffer significant loss as a result of
relying on these expectations. (Scanlon 1998: 300)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a> This is
Scanlon&rsquo;s principle F, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If (1) <i>A</i> voluntarily and intentionally leads <i>B</i> to
expect that <i>A</i> will do <i>X</i> (unless <i>B</i> consents
to <i>A</i>&rsquo;s not doing so); (2) <i>A</i> knows that <i>B</i>
wants to be assured of this; (3) <i>A</i> acts with the aim of
providing this assurance, and has good reason to believe that he or
she has done so; (4) <i>B</i> knows that <i>A</i> has the beliefs and
intentions just described; (5) <i>A</i> intends for <i>B</i> to know
this, and knows that <i>B</i> does know it; and (6) <i>B</i> knows
that <i>A</i> has this knowledge and intent; then, in the absence of
special justification, <i>A</i> must do <i>X</i> unless <i>B</i>
consents to <i>X</i>&rsquo;s not being done. (Scanlon 1998: 304)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a> In some respects,
Scanlon accepts that the principles of promise and contract that his
account justifies depart from conventional understandings of these
moral and legal forms and thus proposes a revisionist view. For
example, Scanlon asserts (on the face of his principle of Fidelity)
that the obligation of promise-keeping arises only when promisors know
that their promisees &ldquo;want[] to be assured&rdquo; that the
promised action will be performed (Scanlon 1998: 304). And he adds
that when a promise creates no expectations, perhaps because it is
disbelieved, no obligation of promise-keeping arises (Scanlon 1998:
311&ndash;314). Both the everyday morality of promising and the law of
contract adopt different positions on both issues.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a> Scanlon says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[I]t is reasonable to want a principle of fidelity that requires
performance rather than compensation and that, once an expectation has
been created, does not always recognize a warning that it will not be
fulfilled as adequate protection against loss, even if the warning is
given before any further decision has been made on the basis of the
expectation. (Scanlon 1998: 304)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a> More precisely,
Scanlon defends a principle, which he calls EF (for enforcing
fidelity) which holds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is permissible legally to enforce remedies for breach of
contract that go beyond compensation for reliance losses, provided
that these remedies are not excessive and that they apply only in
cases in which the following conditions hold: (1) <i>A</i>, the party
against whom the remedy is enforced, has, in the absence of
objectionable constraint and with adequate understanding (or the
ability to acquire such understanding) of his or her situation,
intentionally led <i>B</i> to expect that <i>A</i> would do <i>X</i>
unless <i>B</i> consented to <i>A</i>&rsquo;s not doing so;
(2) <i>A</i> had reason to believe that <i>B</i> wanted to be assured
of this; (3) <i>A</i> acted with the aim of providing this assurance,
by indicating to <i>B</i> that he or she was undertaking a legal
obligation to do <i>X</i>; (4) <i>B</i> indicated that he or she
understood <i>A</i> to have undertaken such an obligation;
(5) <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> knew, or could easily determine, what kind
of remedy <i>B</i> would be legally entitled to if <i>A</i> breached
this obligation; and (6) <i>A</i> failed to do <i>X</i> without being
released from this obligation by <i>B</i>, and without special
justification for doing so. (Scanlon 2001: 105).
</p></blockquote>

<p> Scanlon believes that his argument shows only
that such legal enforcement of contracts is permitted, not that it is
required. See Scanlon 2001: 106. </p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a> T. M. Scanlon
thus embeds these arguments about agreement-keeping in the broader
moral theory that he calls &ldquo;contractualism,&rdquo; according to
which &ldquo;[a]n act is wrong if its performance under the
circumstances would be disallowed by any system of rules for the
general regulation of behaviour which no one could reasonably reject
as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement&rdquo; (Scanlon
1982: 110).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a> The benefits that
Scanlon mentions include the psychological benefit of the confidence
such protection promotes as well as the more direct benefit of
increasing the likelihood that promisors will perform as promised
(Scanlon 1998: 302&ndash;03). Here Scanlon might have added the
benefits associated with encouraging reliance that figure so
prominently in utilitarian and economic accounts of promise and
contract.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a> After all, a
person can always avoid the obligation to satisfy expectations simply
by warning that she is not making any promises.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a> These benefits
accrue, moreover, not just to the promisees who receive them directly
but also to promisors who desire to be able to give firm assurances in
order to increase the value of their promises and hence of what they
can demand in exchange for them. See Scanlon 2001: 108.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a> The error costs
that accrue when legal enforcement is ordered against a person who has
not in fact made an enforceable contract are kept small, Scanlon
asserts, by the strict and fairly formal requirements for entering
into a contract (Scanlon 2001: 108). And the compliance costs that
accrue when a promisor must make good the expectations created by a
promise she has come to regret command little respect in the
contractualist calculus, because they can be avoided <em>ex ante</em>
at a low-cost by refraining from making contractual promises and can
be avoided <em>ex post</em> only by neglecting a moral obligation
imposed by the moral principle of promise-keeping, and this is not a
cost that promisors can reasonably cite as a ground for rejecting the
legal enforcement of contractual expectations (Scanlon 2001).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a> See
generally <em>Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid Co.</em>
(2003), <em>Dastgheib v. Genentech, Inc.</em> (2006), <em>Daily
v. Gusto Records, Inc.</em> (1990), <em>EarthInfo, Inc. v. Hydrosphere
Res. Consultants, Inc.</em> (1995).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a> See,
e.g., <em>Jones v. Star Credit Corp.</em> (1969). The Jones court
applied unconscionability directly to the price term of a consumer
contract.  Quoting Lord Hardwicke, the court proposed that fraud might
be &ldquo;&lsquo;apparent from the intrinsic nature and subject of the
bargain itself; such as no man in his senses and not under delusion
would make&rsquo;&rdquo; (298 N.Y.S.2d 264, 265). Jones thus effectively held that substantive
unconscionability, on its own, might establish a (rebuttable?)
presumption of procedural unconscionability, and thus enable a party
to avoid a contract. This was not far off from holding that the
unconscionability doctrine established (at least for retail sales to
consumers) the principle of a just price in American law. </p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a> See, e.g.,
U.C.C. &sect;2&ndash;719(3)
</p><blockquote><p> [l]imitation of consequential damages for injury
to the person in the case of consumer goods is <em>prima facie</em>
unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial
is not.</p></blockquote>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a> See,
e.g., <em>Patterson v.  Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., Inc.</em>
1971. The Patterson court acknowledged that in a proper case gross
overpricing may be raised as an element of unconscionability, but it
insisted that price (even grossly unreasonable) is only one of the
elements of unconscionability. In particular, Patterson holds that
unconscionability may not be found without an independent
consideration of the whether or not the buyer exercised meaningful
choice in entering into the contract.</p>

<p>The doctrinal discussions in this and <a href="#note-20">note
20</a> follow Daniel Markovits 2012: 1683&ndash;1698.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a> The response to
economic accounts of contract law in this respect follows
Rawls&rsquo;s well-known criticism of utilitarianism, namely that it
&ldquo;does not take seriously the distinction between persons.&rdquo;
(1971: 27).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a> See Stephen
A. Smith 2000: 116&ndash;17. Smith observes that reliance can ground
obligation only if the promisee is entitled to rely and claims that
only a harm-independent account of promissory obligation could
generate such entitlements.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a> Scanlon&rsquo;s
suggestion that contract obligation might be built up out of
obligations not to manipulate others and to take due care when leading
others to form expectations seeks to escape the circle by employing
pre-contractual values to explain the wrongfulness of lying or
careless contractual promises and then building a general principle of
contractual fidelity by reference to the fact that promisees may
reasonably trust promisors to avoid these earlier wrongs. But
Scanlon&rsquo;s theory achieves its results only at the cost of
remaining unable to account for the fact that contract obligation
forbids even honest and careful promisors (who are innocently
overtaken by events) from changing their minds. (For a similar
criticism of Scanlon&rsquo;s view see Kolodny &amp; Wallace 2003:
140.) Scanlon thus requires another idea to explain the strictness of
contractual obligation, and it is difficult to see how the required
idea might simultaneously avoid invoking contingent background
conditions that support only some promises but not all and avoid
importing the obligation to keep contract that requires a defense.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a> Here Scanlon
might have added the benefits associated with encouraging reliance
that figure so prominently in utilitarian and economic accounts of
promise and contract.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a> After all, a
person can always avoid the obligation to satisfy expectations simply
by warning that she is not making any promises.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a> These benefits
accrue, moreover, not just to the promisees who receive them directly
but also to promisors who desire to be able to give firm assurances in
order to increase the value of their promises and hence of what they
can demand in exchange for them. See Scanlon 2001: 108.</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a> The error costs
that accrue when legal enforcement is ordered against a person who has
not in fact made an enforceable contract are kept small, Scanlon
asserts, by the strict and fairly formal requirements for entering
into a contract (Scanlon 2001: 108). And the compliance costs that
accrue when a promisor must make good the expectations created by a
promise she has come to regret command little respect in the
contractualist calculus, because they can be avoided <em>ex ante</em>
at a low-cost by refraining from making contractual promises and can
be avoided <em>ex post</em> only by neglecting a moral obligation
imposed by the moral principle of promise-keeping, and this is not a
cost that promisors can reasonably cite as a ground for rejecting the
legal enforcement of contractual expectations (Scanlon 2001: 108).</p>

<p> <a href="index.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a> Not every court
has always adopted this approach. See, e.g., <em>Parev
Prods. Co. v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc.</em> (1941), which comes
close to taking a fiduciary duty view of contractual obligations,
seeking &ldquo;the really equitable solution&rdquo; as opposed to
