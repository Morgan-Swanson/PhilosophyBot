<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>

David Hume's (1711-1776) wide-ranging philosophical works discuss the
emotions at length, most notably in his <em>Treatise of Human
Nature</em> (1739-40), which devotes the second of its three books to
the passions, as well as in the <em>Dissertation on the Passions</em>
(from <em>Four Dissertations</em> 1757), which covers much the same
material. Because of Hume's sentimentalist bent, his works on moral
philosophy are also important for his understanding of the emotions:
these include Book III of the <em>Treatise</em>, on the moral
sentiments, and the <em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of
Morals</em> (1751). Hume's essays, published in various editions
during his lifetime, also cover diverse topics related to the
emotions, such as &ldquo;Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of Love and Marriage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Of Superstition and
Enthusiasm&rdquo; (1741), and &ldquo;Of the Standard of Taste&rdquo;
(1757). Other texts, such as his autobiographical sketches, and the
six volumes of his <em>History of England</em> (1754-62), offer
material illustrating Hume's views on the topic. The
<em>Treatise</em>, however, contains ample material to serve as a
starting point.</p>

<h3><a name="Ter">2. Terminology</a></h3>

<p> 

Hume groups the emotions in general among the perceptions of the mind,
although they also serve as motivations for acting and even for
reasoning. When the word &lsquo;emotion&rsquo; itself appears in his
writings, however, it seems to mean simply some kind of motion.
Instead, Hume uses an array of terms to describe our affective
perceptions, especially the &lsquo;passion,&rsquo;
&lsquo;sentiment&rsquo; and &lsquo;taste&rsquo; familiar from
Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. But Hume provides several new
twists. Unlike Hutcheson, he divides passions themselves into calm and
violent. Like Hutcheson, however, he seems to take passions to be
relatively low-order perceptions, in contrast to the reflective
character of sentiments. Although the <em>Treatise</em> is not
particularly forthcoming on the use of these terms, the essay
&ldquo;Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion&rdquo; presents a clear
contrast between that &ldquo;higher and more refined taste,&rdquo;
which is also identified with sentiment, and the violent passions that
disturb susceptible souls (Hume 1985 6).  Sentiment and taste are calm
affective states, susceptible to cultivation, subject to standards and
capable of reining in the excesses of overly &ldquo;delicate,&rdquo;
i.e., violent, passions.</p>

<h3><a name="ConBooTre">3. Conclusion to Book I of the <em>Treatise</em></a></h3>

<p>

Hume does not merely discuss the emotions theoretically, he narrates
the philosophical experience of them in the &ldquo;Conclusion to this
Book&rdquo; that closes Book I of the <em>Treatise</em>. This section
treats the narrator's emotional landscape as a response to his
skeptical conclusions about reason, sense-perception, and the
self. The narrator feels himself &ldquo;a strange, uncouth
monster,&rdquo; shunned by society and marooned in a skeptical
isolation in which even his views about how to limit his beliefs are
unstable (T I.4.7 264).  Hume treats this unhappy, skeptical view as a
kind of illness, which eventually receives a cure from &ldquo;nature
herself.&rdquo; The first sign of a return to health is &ldquo;a
splenetic humour&rdquo; that rejects philosophy (T I.4.7 269). But the
conclusion resolves with the narrator replacing his despairing
skepticism with a cheerful skepticism that is &ldquo;diffident of
[its] philosophical doubts, as well as of [its] philosophical
conviction&rdquo; (T I.4.7 273). This seems a fruitful approach, for
the <em>Treatise</em> goes on for two more Books, philosophizing in a
&ldquo;careless,&rdquo; i.e., carefree, manner (see Baier 1991
1ff.).</p>

<p>

The exact source of the &ldquo;philosophical melancholy and
delirium&rdquo; in Book I, and just how nature comes to the rescue are
matters of much debate. What seems clear is that the cure wrought by
nature is a matter of a change of affective state &ndash; &ldquo;the
returns of a serious good humour'd disposition&rdquo; (T I.4.7 270) &ndash;
rather than the cultivation of any new beliefs or reasoning
techniques. This new mood inclines him again to philosophy, and the
<em>Treatise</em> proceeds to topics neglected in the first book,
particularly the nature of our passions and sentiments and how they
fit us for social life. The motivation throughout is affective:
pleasure, an &ldquo;ambition &hellip; of contributing to the
instruction of mankind&rdquo; (T I.4.7 271), and above all,
curiosity. Although this curiosity is not exactly the same as
Descartes's and Malebranche's &ldquo;wonder,&rdquo; Hume does declare
in the conclusion of Book II that the &ldquo;first source of all our
enquiries&rdquo; is &ldquo;curiosity, or that love of truth&rdquo; (T
II.3.10 448). It drives both philosophy and hunting, of which
&ldquo;there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each
other&rdquo; (T II.3.10 451), although the passion for gambling comes
close. The passion for hunting down truth becomes yet stronger when
directed at the objects that intrinsically interest us: human nature,
particularly the shared passions and sentiments that motivate us and
our interactions with other people &ndash; in short, the topics of
Books II and III of the <em>Treatise</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPasBooTre">4. The Classification of the Passions in Book II of the <em>Treatise</em></a></h3>

<p>

The perceptions of the mind divide into two kinds: impressions and
ideas (roughly, feeling and thinking): &ldquo;Those perceptions, which
enter with most force and violence, we may name <em>impressions</em>;
and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and
emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul. By
<em>ideas</em> I mean the faint images of these in thinking and
reasoning &hellip;&rdquo; (T I.1.1 1). Hume proposes a scale of
vivacity, in which impressions are vivid, ideas are faint, and beliefs
(e.g., in the existence of things we do not presently perceive) are
somewhere in the middle. But ideas can borrow vivacity from other
sources through the principles of association found in the
imagination.</p>

<p>

Impressions can also be divided into two kinds: impressions of sense
(original) and impressions of reflection (secondary). The impressions
of sense include all our sensations, as well as perceptions of
pleasure and pain; the impressions of reflection include all our
passions and sentiments. In Book I.1.2, Hume says that the impressions
of sense arise in the soul &ldquo;originally, from unknown
causes&rdquo; (T I.1.2 7), whereas secondary impressions
&ldquo;proceed from some of these original ones, either immediately or
by the interposition of its idea&rdquo; (T II.1.1 275). Still, Hume
considers even secondary impressions to be in some sense
&ldquo;original existences:&rdquo; they may follow on the heels of a
distinct impression (sensory or reflective) or idea, but are not
copies of them. On the other hand, impressions can be related
associatively through resemblance, and it is the associative
constructions they allow that provide structure to our often chaotic
thought processes (particularly through &ldquo;the double relation of
impressions and ideas&rdquo; discussed below).</p>

<p>

The passions, then, are impressions of reflection. The
<em>Treatise</em> separates this broad categorization into calm and
violent passions (although other of Hume's works seem to reserve
&ldquo;passion&rdquo; for the violent ones). But this &ldquo;vulgar
and specious division&rdquo; doesn't play much role in the
<em>Treatise</em>, and Hume insists that calm passions are not
necessarily weak, nor violent ones strong. More important for Hume's
purposes is the distinction between direct and indirect
passions. Direct passions arise immediately from &ldquo;good or evil,
from plain or pleasure;&rdquo; indirect passions require the
&ldquo;conjunction of other qualities,&rdquo; particularly the
interposition of an idea (T II.1.1 276). Curiosity, or love of truth
falls among the direct passions, which also include desire and
aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear, and somewhat oddly,
volition. But it is the indirect passions of pride and humility, love
and hate that are analyzed first in Book II.</p>

<h3><a name="DouRelImpIdeCasPri">5. The Double Relation of Impressions and Ideas in the Case of Pride</a></h3>

<p>

Indirect passions differ from the direct, in part, because of their
complicated intentionality. They have objects; they also have causes,
which can be further subdivided into the quality that excites the
passion and the subject in which it inheres. In the case of pride, the
object is self. The cause is the pleasing quality in a subject that is
(somehow) related to self. This forms the framework on which Hume
builds the &ldquo;double relation of ideas and impressions&rdquo; (T
II.1.5 286), in which impressions of sense are related to resembling
passions, and ideas of the cause are related through various
principles of association to the object of the passion. It is the
whole structure that seems to characterize the passion, as we may see
in the case of pride. The cause of pride has a quality that gives a
pleasurable perception, which is found in a subject, the idea of which
is related to the idea of self. Consider, for example, the pleasurable
passion of pride Mr. Darcy may take in his beautiful estate:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td><em>Cause</em></td>
<td><em>(quality)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>Passion</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Impressions:</em></td>
<td>Pleasure</td>
<td>&mdash;(resemblance)&rarr;</td>
<td>Pride</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&uarr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Ideas:</em></td>
<td>My<br />Estate</td>
<td>&mdash;(causation)&rarr;</td>
<td>Self<br />(Mr. Darcy)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Cause</em></td>
<td><em>(subject)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>Object</em></td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The same structure can be found in the other indirect passions of
humility, love and hate, as Hume shows in &ldquo;experiments to
confirm this system&rdquo; (T II.2.2 332), although either the quality
of the cause, or the relations the idea of the subject bears will be
different for each passion. For instance, that which produces pride
when connected to self can produce love in another, as when the
beautiful estate excites love in Elizabeth for Mr. Darcy:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td><em>Cause</em></td>
<td><em>(quality)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>Passion</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Impressions:</em></td>
<td>Pleasure</td>
<td>&mdash;(resemblance)&rarr;</td>
<td>Love</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&uarr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Ideas:</em></td>
<td>Mr. Darcy's<br />Estate</td>
<td>&mdash;(causation)&rarr;</td>
<td>Mr. Darcy<br />(another)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Cause</em></td>
<td><em>(subject)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>Object</em></td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Similarly, Elizabeth's dreadful relations may excite humility in
Elizabeth and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; in Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>

It is worth remarking that Hume begins his discussion of the passions
with pride. Its role for Hume may bear comparison to the importance
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; held for Hobbes, although they are clearly not the
same passion. Almost anything that invokes pleasurable impressions can
be the cause of pride, within the limitations that the idea of the
subject must allow us to build associative connections directing the
mind to the idea of self. The idea of self seems, however, to be
intrinsically attention-grabbing, which explains why love for another
somehow connected to us readily converts into pride, but not
vice-versa (so I may readily feel pride when considering my children's
many accomplishments, but consideration of my own accomplishments does
not tend to provoke love for my children). Against the
&ldquo;monkish&rdquo; preference for humility, Hume emphasizes that
virtue itself can be a just cause of pride, one that becomes all the
more powerful as our passions reverberate socially through the
mechanism Hume calls &ldquo;sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Perhaps the most curious feature of pride is its indispensable
relation to the idea of self. The penultimate chapter of Book I of the
<em>Treatise</em> (I.4.6) advances a highly skeptical account of the
idea of self, maintaining that we have no such simple idea, but at
best the idea of an organized bundle: a &ldquo;kind of theatre, where
several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass,
glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and
situations,&rdquo; but without even &ldquo;the most distant notion of
the place, where these scenes are represented&rdquo; (T I.4.6 253).
Hume seems to find this a distressing thought, but allows that we
&ldquo;must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it regards our
thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the concern
we take in ourselves&rdquo; (T I.4.6 253). The introduction of the
passion of pride, with its essential focus on self, shortly thereafter
may bear this distinction out. Indeed, pride seems both to require
reference to an idea of the self, and to buttress whatever meager idea
we may already have by directing the mind to an idea of the self
outfitted with various pleasurable associations. Hume needs some trick
to fortify the idea of the self, because he will rely on our
possession of a lively idea of the self, one that will serve as a
source of vivacity, for his account of the sympathetic communication
of passions.</p>

<h3><a name="SymCom">6. Sympathy and Comparison</a></h3>

<p>

Sympathy is not itself a passion; it is not the passion of
&ldquo;pity,&rdquo; nor of &ldquo;compassion.&rdquo; Rather, it is a
causal mechanism, whereby we come to feel the passions we suppose
others feel. In its simplest form, it starts with an observation of
the outward signs of a passion in another (e.g., facial expressions,
behavior, talk), from which we form an idea of, indeed a belief in,
the existence of some passion. Sympathy vivifies that idea into an
impression, that is, a passion, by borrowing from the ever-present,
and lively sense of self. We do need some sort of associations between
the idea of the other and the idea of self for this transfer of
vivacity to work. But they are easy to come by: any sort of relation
between another person &ndash; contiguity, causation, or even simple
resemblance &ndash; can grease the associative wheels whereby an idea
of another's passion becomes a genuine passion in us.</p>

<p>

Hume's account owes a great deal to Malebranche's account of the
mechanical communication of passions. But Hume does not assume that
sympathy produces exactly the same passion in us as we imagine in
another, particularly because the transfer may alter the object of the
passion. For instance, sympathy can convert the love and admiration
others feel for us into pride; indeed, Hume introduces the mechanism
of sympathy to explain our &ldquo;love of fame,&rdquo; even in cases
when we expect no particular advantage from their actions and take no
other interest in their opinions. To be sure, the love of fame still
represents a communication of &ldquo;like to like,&rdquo; since love
and pride are both pleasurable passions. But Hume elaborates on
sympathy to show how our affective communications can produce very
different kinds of passions (cf., James 2005, Schmitter 2010).</p>

<p>

Comparison, a mechanism built on sympathy, produces passions with
affective tendencies directly opposed to those we sympathize with in
others. It works by invoking another principle, superadded to the
operations of sympathy: &ldquo;<em>that objects appear greater or less
by a comparison with others</em>&rdquo; (T II.2.8 375). If, for
instance, we come, through sympathy, to feel the unhappy passion of
another, we may feel our own (comparatively) happy non-sympathetic
passions all the more strongly. The operations of comparison, thus,
work to increase the pleasurable (or painful) passions we feel by
letting us feel the contrasting painful (or pleasurable) passions of
others (but cf. Postema 2005, Schmitter 2010). Hume uses comparison to
explain the possibility of envy, and even more, of malice, a sort of
&ldquo;pity reverst,&rdquo; involving an &ldquo;unprovok'd desire of
producing evil to another&rdquo; (T II.2.8 377). This differs from
hate and other simpler passions, because the desire is unprovoked by
any injury or even a desire to obtain some good for ourselves (other
than reaping pleasure from the comparison). In this respect, Hume
parts company with everyone from Hobbes to Hutcheson, in recognizing
the existence of a seemingly disinterested, anti-social emotion. In
general, Hume treats comparison as producing socially destructive
passions, while sympathy produces sociable ones, but these do not seem
to be the inevitable consequences of each mechanism. And Hume does not
seem to assume that the production of like from like is the only, or
even the primary, way in which the communication of passions promotes
social cohesion.</p>

<h3><a name="ReaOugOnlSlaPas">7. &ldquo;Reason Is and Ought Only to Be the Slave of the Passions&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>

One of the most notorious of Hume's views about the passions concerns
their relation to our practical reason. Hume locates all our
motivations in the passions. Perhaps for this reason, he treats the
will in his discussion of the direct passions, identifying it as
&ldquo;the internal impression we feel and are conscious of, when we
knowingly give rise to any new motion of our body, or new perception
of our mind&rdquo; (T II.3.1 399). If the will did not determine a
person's actions, we would have no way to trace those actions to their
springs in character, which is the prerequisite for forming moral
judgments.</p>

<p>

Hume is particularly concerned with analyzing our practical reasoning,
our reasoning about how to act. Passions are the engine for all our
deeds: without passions we would lack all motivation, all impulse or
drive to act, or even to reason (practically or theoretically). This
gives at least one sense in which &ldquo;reason is, and ought only to
be the slave of the passions&rdquo; (T II.3.3 415). Hume also holds
that the passions are not themselves directly subject to rational
evaluation. In fact, it seems something of a category mistake to think
that they could be either rational or irrational. Passions are
impressions &ndash; strong and lively perceptions with a certain
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; and a direction, or impulse. Reasoning, however, is
a matter of connecting various ideas in order to come to a belief; it
may apply to, or even form, the circumstances under which passions
arise. But reason can generate no impulse by itself.</p>

<p>

For these reasons, many have attributed to Hume a belief-desire model
of practical reasoning, in which our ends are given by passions
(desires). On this view, reason is in the business of producing
beliefs, but our beliefs are relevant only to the means by which we
seek to obtain those ends: they do not determine the ends
themselves. So, reason has only an instrumental use. But whatever its
other virtues, this model does little to explain why reason
&ldquo;ought to be&rdquo; the slave of the passions. It also seems
inappropriate to reduce passions to desires: passions have a great
deal more structure than their attractive or aversive directions,
important though those may be. What seems central to Hume's view is
the inertness of reason, its inability to generate impulses for the
mind (see Millgram 1995). And it is this that drives Hume to adopt a
sentimentalist basis for the origins of our &ldquo;moral
distinctions&rdquo; (T III.1.2).</p>

<h3><a name="SenArtVir">8. The Sentiments and Artificial Virtues</a></h3>

<p>

When Hume turns to our moral &ldquo;sense&rdquo; in Book III of the
<em>Treatise</em>, he largely abandons talk of passions in favor of
&ldquo;sentiment.&rdquo; He still takes it that our sense of the
morality of an action or character is motivating; for one, it moves us
to pursue or avoid the action or person. Like Shaftesbury and
Hutcheson, Hume also considers our moral judgments to be directed at
the voluntary actions of others, which are rooted in motivating
emotions, especially insofar as they represent enduring dispositions,
or character. Moral sentiments seem to involve an important element of
judgment, but they also bear a close relation to motives for action,
and so may be considered a species of passion, broadly understood.</p>

<p>

However, Hume's moral psychology also adds important elements to the
analysis of the passions we have already seen. Hume divides virtues
into the natural and the artificial. Both kinds present puzzles about
how they become the objects of sentiments, so that we feel that they
impose an &ldquo;obligation.&rdquo; But artificial virtues are
particularly tricky cases, since we have no natural motivation to
approve them. Artificial virtues, such as justice, or the somewhat
simpler example of promise-keeping, are neither uncommon, nor
arbitrary, but they do rest on an artifice, or social convention.
Moreover, however useful (or pleasant), the practices informed by
those conventions may be in general, particular instances of the
behavior they describe may not be. Keeping a promise, say, to respect
a deadline, may not promote anyone's good. The difficulty for Hume is
to explain why we nonetheless typically experience pleasurable
sentiments directed at instances of promise-keeping, despite the
artificial foundation of the practice.</p>

<p>

Hume's solution to the puzzle is to invoke sympathy, but &ldquo;an
extensive sympathy,&rdquo; redirected through general rules and the
social convention toward society as a whole. This sympathy in turn
requires various kinds of correction, provided by adopting &ldquo;some
steady and general points of view&rdquo; (T III.3.1 581-2), which Hume
illustrates through his version of the transition from the state of
nature to full-blown society. In the spirit of Shaftesbury and
Hutcheson, he begins by appeal to basic other-directed emotions: it is
natural and universal for humans to form families and to feel greater
affection for members of their families.  But such familial generosity
is limited in its scope, and can be as much a source of social
conflict as any selfish passion. Realizing the problem, we readily
find conventions to correct it &ndash; conventions established slowly
and without any express &lsquo;covenanting.&rsquo; What motivates our
behavior in establishing such conventions are precisely the natural
passions that generated conflict, including limited generosity, but
mediated by a greater insight into how to obtain our ends.</p>

<p>

Still, we will not generate the sentiments required by the
artificial virtues, until we manage to direct our generous passions
beyond their natural bounds, allowing us to approve of the justice or
honesty of all sorts of people in all sorts of situations, no matter
their connection to us. And this means we must somehow acquire genuine
sympathy with the public interest as a whole. To do so, Hume demands
that sympathy operate to communicate passions between persons who are
not immediately present to each other and that it operate
counter-factually, according to general rules. In this way, we learn
to sympathize from a general point of view. It is that general point
of view that allows us to feel the distinctive sentiments of
approbation grounding our moral judgments about virtue, whether
artificial or natural. Moral virtues will then turn out to be
qualities of behavior and character that are either pleasurable (e.g.,
kindliness or wit) or useful (e.g., parental care, justice, or
promise-keeping) considered from the general point of view.</p>

<h3><a name="GenPoiVieStaAppSen">9. The General Point of View and Standards of Appropriateness for the Sentiments</a></h3>

<p>

There is a great deal more to be said about how we construct the
general point of view. But what is particularly interesting for our
purposes is to consider how it figures as a standard for the
experience of sentiments. The general point of view both extends the
scope of the sentiments we feel, and corrects them by providing some
sense of what we ought to feel. To be sure, we may also feel many
uncorrected passions, whether prejudices or innocuous preferences for
what is naturally connected to us. But Hume emphasizes that the
corrections provided by the general point of view are far-ranging,
extending beyond the moral sentiments to the formation of aesthetic
taste, and influencing even seemingly straightforward perceptual
judgments. The general point of view is not, of course, a standard of
rationality; rather, it is a standard of appropriateness. It is that
standard that allows us to shape, cultivate and constrain our
sentiments in ways that provide the sort of stability and reliability
that will form the basis for shared judgment.</p>

<p>

It is a matter of controversy, however, whether the general point of
view alone provides a genuinely normative standard (see, e.g., Korsgaard
1999). It is clear that it allows sentiments to be coordinated across
a society, so that much of what its members feel will be more or less
uniform and generally accessible, without the vicissitudes to which
the uncorrected and idiosyncratic passions of individuals in peculiar
circumstances are subject. But this may simply mean that the general
point of view levels out sentiments to what is socially average and
widely accepted. Hume does seem to think that we have something more
robust than social acceptance as a standard for our sentiments. But it
is his musings on our aesthetic judgments that may provide the best
example of a genuine standard of taste.</p>

<h3><a name="JudTas">10. The Judgment of Taste</a></h3>

<p>

The essay &ldquo;Of the Standard of Taste&rdquo; begins by admitting
the &ldquo;<em>de gustibus</em>&rdquo; principle: there is no
disputing taste. In many respects, this simply follows from Hume's
sentimentalist approach to aesthetic judgments: like moral judgments,
they are based on sense and sentiment, not reason.  Nevertheless, we
have a real standard for taste, in the taste of a good judge who is in
the correct position for judgment. In part, the good judge's ability
seems a matter of adopting a general point of view so that the judge
is not so prejudiced by peculiarities of her own position as to be
incapacitated for judging as &lsquo;one&rsquo; generally does. This
requirement may disqualify some candidates on completely
circumstantial grounds, even those who might make perfectly good
judges under other circumstances. Parents, for instance, rarely make
good judges of their own children's artworks, even when they are
professional art critics.</p>

<p>

But the good judge must possess specific qualifications, particularly
those of practice and experience in judging. Such experience can help
judges to filter out peculiarities of their own position, that is, to
adopt the general point of view. But it also seems to afford the judge
resources that bear on the judging itself.  Particularly important to
the good judge is &ldquo;delicacy&rdquo; in her discernment. Hume provides
an example in the story told by Sancho Panza in <em>Don Quixote</em>
of the feats of two of his ancestors in wine-tasting. On being
presented with what was universally declared a particularly fine
&ldquo;hogshead&rdquo; of wine, both approved of it, except that one
noted a faint touch of leather and the other a tinge of iron. Their
judgments were ridiculed until the hogshead was drained and a key on a
leathern thong was found at the bottom, &ldquo;which justified the
verdict of Sancho's kinsmen, and confounded those pretended judges who
had condemned them&rdquo; (Hume 1985 235). The good judge should
possess the sort of developed perception that allows her to detect
fine differences that may nonetheless be relevant to judgment. This is
not sufficient for good judgment, but is required for credibility, and
can provide a publicly accessible check.</p>

<p>

Hume maintains that &ldquo;the great resemblance between mental and
bodily taste will easily teach us to apply this story&rdquo; (Hume
1985 235). Presumably, he thinks that sensory qualities such as taste
are like moral and aesthetic qualities in that they are secondary, not
inherent properties of things, &ldquo;but belong entirely to the
sentiment, internal or external&rdquo; (Hume 1985 235).  But they do
supervene on properties of things, those &ldquo;qualities in
objects,&rdquo; which are fitted by nature to produce the particular
feelings. The good judge, then, like the wine-tasters of the story,
may possess a developed ability to detect those formal qualities in
art works, or to descry whatever properties of people's actions might
be relevant to the formation of our moral sentiments. The good judge
would then be able to justify her judgment by pointing out salient
features of what is being judged that others might miss. A good judge
will thus be a good critic and teacher of appropriate taste. And so,
the good judge may provide standards that are neither completely
independent of the sentiments we are fitted to experience, nor merely
hostage to the common run of passions. </p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">11. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>

Hume's influence on later authors may be most evident in those
features of his approach that differ from previous treatments of the
emotions and moral sense. Certainly, his account of how our sentiments
can be developed historically and socially was important to
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and his explanation of the standard in our
judgments of taste served as both a model and foil for many later
theorists. Adam Smith seems to have taken some of the issues Hume
raised about the normative standards for moral judgments particularly
seriously in his <em>Theory of the Moral Sentiments</em> (1759). Like
Hume, he considers sympathy to provide the engine for such a
standard. But on Smith's view, sympathy operates less to communicate
the passions we suppose others actually feel than to allow us to
imagine what it would be like to be in their place. Sympathy arises
from our view of the situation that excites it, and puts us in the
position of a spectator on that situation. There are, in fact, a
number of such points of view, but they all seem inherently normative,
for what the spectator considers is what one <em>ought</em> to feel in
the situation, and one form of moral judgment concerns the
appropriateness of an agent's response to the situation. Because we
can also adopt the stance of a spectator on our own sentiments and
actions, we have the resources for evaluating our own emotional
reactions; Smith criticizes the moral sense theory of Hutcheson for
disallowing the importance, and indeed even the possibility of doing
so. Smith's spectator is not exactly the same as Hume's good judge,
especially since the sympathetic spectator occupies a normative
position independently of constructing a general point of view. But
the highly idealized spectator and the sorts of normative checks that
can be provided by adopting somewhat different spectator positions can
be seen as a response to and development of Hume's analyses of the
interactions of our sentiments in creating the general point of view
and standards for judgment.</p>
