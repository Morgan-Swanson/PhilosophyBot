<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>

Descartes starts his <em>Passions of the Soul</em> (1649) by lamenting
the sorry state of ancient writings on the passions, and declaring
that &ldquo;I shall be obliged to write just as if I were considering
a topic that no one had dealt with before me&rdquo; (AT XI 328, CSM I
328). It is true that he rejects aspects of Aquinas's views and
explicitly tasks those cruel philosophers who &ldquo;require their
sage to be insensible&rdquo; (whom he identifies as the
&ldquo;Cynics,&rdquo; then considered to represent a particularly
austere form of Stoicism). But he also adopts many features of
previous accounts. For instance, he uses the Stoic and Galenist notion
of animal spirits (tailored to his own mechanistic physics), cites
Vives on the physiology of laughter (AT XI 422, CSM I 372), and shows
numerous, if rarely acknowledged, debts to Montaigne, Lipsius, and
Suarez. Perhaps most notably, he adopts &ldquo;passion&rdquo; as his
preferred vocabulary, contrasting it with action in a way that harks
back to Aristotle.</p>

<h3><a name="ProTheFunPas">2. The Project of Theodicy and the Function of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

Much of the context for Descartes's approach to the passions lies in
his <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (1641) (and the
corresponding sections of the 1644 <em>Principles of
Philosophy</em>). As part of a general defense of God's goodness in
the face of seeming shortcomings in our nature, the Sixth Meditation
seeks to justify the way in which we are equipped to respond to the
outside world by experiencing sensations, appetites, and
passions. Descartes has already argued that these confused,
bodily-based perceptions are the source of much theoretical error,
since they tempt us to attribute properties of our sensation to the
extended world. Their theoretical confusion, however, is merely the
flip side to their practical functionality: such perceptions provide
guides for maneuvering our bodies through the world, and ultimately
for preserving the mind-body union that constitutes the human
being. But practical efficiency comes at the cost of some
fallibility. Under non-standard conditions (e.g., when we suffer from
illness, or body parts go missing), our signposts may lead us
astray. This is because they are generated by purely mechanical laws,
according to a machine design that under normal circumstances allows
them to serve certain ends, as is the case with a well-built
watch. Thus, bodily-based perceptions are explained
<em>functionally</em>: they are justified by way of their purposes,
but how they serve those ends requires resort to strictly mechanical
causation. The functional character, as well as the confusion, of
these perceptions seems founded on their mixed ontological status:
they are modes that can &ldquo;not be referred either to the mind
alone or to the body alone&rdquo; (<em>Principles</em>, AT VIII 23,
CSM I 209, see also Hoffman 1990 and Brown, 2006). Although the Meditations
concentrates on our disposition to experience sense qualia, which
normally mark qualities and differences between qualities of external
things in relation to us, Descartes's defense may work better for the
appetites and passions. For these perceptions seem to have a built-in
evaluative component that is directly related to their
purposiveness (see Schmitter 2007). Later works address this feature of the passions
explicitly.</p>

<h3><a name="PasMedFre">3. Passions, Medicine and Freedom</a></h3>

<p>

The relation between the emotions and health is the topic of the
correspondence between Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia in
1643 and 1645. Starting with a letter of 6 May 1643 (AT III 660,
Shapiro 2007 61-2), Elisabeth queries Descartes on how such
metaphysically disparate things as mind and body can act on each
other, to which Descartes responds by emphasizing that the mind and
body form a genuine union. But by 1645, the topic shifts slightly to
whether the mind can control the body, particularly its
passions. Descartes diagnoses a &ldquo;low grade fever&rdquo; from
which Elisabeth has been suffering as caused by sadness or melancholy,
and recommends the familiarly Stoic-sounding remedy of reading Seneca,
while reflecting on her mind and its ability to master bodily-based
passions. Elisabeth takes exception to this suggestion, remarking that
her &ldquo;body imbued with a large part of the weaknesses of my sex
&hellip; is afflicted very easily by the afflictions of the
soul&rdquo; (Elisabeth to Descartes, 24 May 1645, AT IV 208, Shapiro
2007 88).  Despite the reference to her particular weakness, her point
is general: there are certain <em>bodily</em> conditions &ndash;
illness, weakness, stress, or just a &ldquo;touch of the vapors&rdquo;
&ndash; that interfere with the mental activities of reasoning and
willing, make us more prone to the passions, and thereby compromise
our ability to apply the cure Descartes has recommended. Elisabeth
here raises an important issue for the kind of neo-Stoic view
Descartes advances in their correspondence: even if some people manage
resolutely to overcome the passions and achieve happiness, is it
possible to do so &ldquo;without the assistance of that which does not
depend absolutely on the will?&rdquo; (Descartes to Elisabeth, 1
September 1645, AT IV 281-2, modified from CSMK 262.)  This question
haunts many other early modern treatments of the emotions, and Spinoza
in particular, adopts views that seem very close to Elisabeth's
concerns.</p>

<h3><a name="DefPasSou">4. The Definition of the <em>Passions of the Soul</em></a></h3>

<p>

The correspondence with Elisabeth prodded Descartes to produce his
most important text on the emotions, the <em>Passions of the
Soul</em>, in response to her demand to &ldquo;define the passions, in
order to know them better&rdquo; (Elisabeth to Descartes, 13 September
1645, AT IV 289, Shapiro 2007 110). The <em>Passions of the Soul</em>
may not be a completely satisfactory explanation of mind-body union,
but it does provide the definition Elisabeth asked for, an intricate
taxonomy of the passions, a description of their bodily causes,
effects and function, and an account of the &ldquo;discipline of
virtue&rdquo; that addresses the means and extent to which we can
regulate the passions.</p>

<p>

Descartes's definition of &ldquo;passion&rdquo; works by honing in on
stricter and stricter senses of the term. In the first place, passions
are simply those &ldquo;functions&rdquo; of the soul that are not
actions: namely, perceptions. But since actions, such as volitions,
can themselves be perceived, Descartes prefers to restrict the term to
those perceptions caused by the body. Even this is a bit too broad,
and so Descartes defines passions proper as &ldquo;those perceptions,
sensations or emotions of the soul which we refer particularly to it,
and which are caused, maintained and strengthened by some movement of
the spirits&rdquo; (AT XI 349, CSM I 338-9).  Descartes thereby
locates passions squarely in <em>perception</em>, although he gives a
nod to other views by calling them &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; (motions,
changes, agitations, disturbances). Referring them to the soul allows
him to distinguish passions from other bodily-based perceptions, such
as the sense-perceptions we refer to external objects. What Descartes
means by &ldquo;referred to the soul&rdquo; here is none too clear,
except insofar as he maintains that the experience of the passions
cannot be localized in some part of the body (as can feelings of pain
or heat), and indeed, &ldquo;we do not normally know any proximate
cause to which we can refer them&rdquo; (AT XI 347, CSM I 337). (Note
that Descartes uses &ldquo;cause&rdquo; in several different senses
throughout the <em>Passions</em>; cause here cannot be identified with
the object.) The last part of the definition &ndash; that the passions
are &ldquo;caused, maintained and strengthened by some movement of the
spirits&rdquo; &ndash; is also important for differentiating the
passions from non-bodily-based perceptions, such as voluntary
imaginings. The &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; whose movement Descartes
discusses here are the animal spirits of Galenist physiology,
reinterpreted in light of Harvey's discovery of the circulatory system
and his own mechanist principles: they are simply fine and lively
parts of the blood, rarified by the heart and brain, and passing
through the brain to the nerves and then to the muscles to produce
bodily motions. The physiology of the passions is an important
component in the accounts of the causes, effects, functions and
regulation of the passions. Each of the main passions receives a
detailed description of the bodily changes that accompany it, such as
changes in color, body temperature, facial expression, disposition of
the limbs and the like, which can in turn be attributed to the
movements of the spirits and heart.</p>

<p>

The principal effect of the passions is to &ldquo;move and dispose the
soul to want the things for which they prepare the body&rdquo; (AT XI
359, CSM I 343). They act on the soul by way of &ldquo;the agitation
by which the spirits move the little gland [i.e., the pineal gland] in
the middle of the brain&rdquo; (AT XI 371, CSM I 349), which thereby
excite various perceptions in the soul. (For further discussion of
this topic, see the related entry
 <a href="../pineal-gland/">Descartes and the Pineal Gland</a>.)
But the pineal gland can be moved by many different causes. For this
reason, Descartes admits that many other kinds of perceptions and
volitions stand in close causal and experiential relations to the
passions proper. Particularly important are what Descartes calls
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; or &ldquo;internal emotions,&rdquo; such as
the intellectual devotion felt when contemplating the idea of the true
God, or the sadness that stems from reflecting on my errors. These have
the soul as their cause, and so are properly speaking, volitions, but
they are also affective states, and in embodied creatures such as we
are they may be difficult to disentangle from bodily-based
passions.</p>

<p>

Each genuine passion is characterized by an account of its
motivational force (for which the &ldquo;reference to the soul&rdquo;
is important), paired with a description of how it &ldquo;represents&rdquo; its
object, which under normal conditions is also the cause of the series
of bodily changes resulting in the passion. Although he does not deny
that each passion has some distinctive felt character, Descartes
offers no description of it other than the presentation of the object
under some evaluative description and its effect on the will. In
general, the &ldquo;principal and most common causes&rdquo; are
objects, considered according to &ldquo;the various ways in which they
may harm or benefit us, or in general have importance for us&rdquo;
(AT XI 372, CSM I 349).  Passions are not judgments, since judgments
require an act of the will to affirm or deny. But they do have
complex, &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; contents: through the passion of
fear, I perceive that an oncoming train is dangerous to me, viz., I
perceive it as dangerous. It is because these contents are evaluative
that the passions will be motivating in ways that are normally
functional.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPas">5. The Classification of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

Descartes identifies six &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions: wonder,
which he calls &ldquo;the first of all the passions,&rdquo; love and
hatred, desire, and joy and sadness. They are each distinct: desire,
for instance, is directed at the future, whereas love is a passion
involving a &ldquo;consent by which we consider ourselves from the
present on as joined with which we love, in the sense that we imagine
a whole of which we think of ourselves only as one part and the loved
thing as another&rdquo; (AT XI 387, modified from CSM I 356). And each of these
passions, except for wonder, have a built-in direction of motion,
either appetitive or aversive depending on how they evaluate their
objects &ndash; a feature that serves as an important organizing
principle for Descartes. On this basis, Descartes opposes love to
hatred, and joy to sadness. Desire has no opposite, since it comprises
both appetites and aversions.</p>

<p>

Descartes also accepts &ldquo;an unlimited number&rdquo; of further,
specific passions, which he calls combinations of the six primitive
passions. But he seems to find his most important taxonomical
principles elsewhere, e.g., in the passion's intensity (timidity is
different from terror), whether its object is oneself or another
(self-esteem differs from veneration), and in further modifications of
the object and its relation to us (love is distinguished from the
devotion we feel for an object &ldquo;greater&rdquo; than we are, such
as God). Descartes allows that some passions involve mixtures, even
contrary mixtures as in hope and fear. But since passions literally
push the pineal gland in a particular direction, movements in
different directions tend to cancel each other out. Passions seem to
&lsquo;combine&rsquo; most readily by producing trains of passions:
desire may give rise to love, which may in turn generate joy. Trains
of passions may involve passions with contrary directions, but this
produces the rather uncomfortable sensations of remorse, or
repentance.  In fact, Descartes takes it as a basic explanatory
principle that the passions do not oppose each other, and rejects the
Thomist distinction between irascible and concupiscible appetites, and
correlative divisions in the soul itself (AT XI 379, CSM I 352). The
sort of conflicts that this distinction was supposed to explain
Descartes instead attributes to different causes, to movements coming
from the soul (the will) and to movements originating in the body,
which can, but need not, propel the pineal gland in contrary
directions.</p>

<h3><a name="WonGen">6. Wonder and Generosity</a></h3>

<p>

Perhaps the most distinctive of the passions that Descartes
identifies, however is the one that involves no evaluation of its
object: wonder [<em>admiration</em>] merely presents its object as
something novel or unusual. As such, wonder produces no change in the
heart or the blood, which would prepare the body for movement. But it
does involve the motions of the animal spirits through the brain and
into the muscles, thereby fixing an &ldquo;impression&rdquo; of the
object in the brain. And that explains the function of wonder: to
&ldquo;learn and retain in our memory things of which we were
previously ignorant&rdquo; (AT XI 384, CSM I 354). It is our response
to those features of the world worthy of our consideration &ndash;
something useful both for the preservation of the mind-body union and
for the soul itself in its pursuit of knowledge. Descartes's
understanding of wonder may well recall Aristotle's famous dictum that
philosophy begins with wonder. But wherever it begins, Descartes
certainly does not think it should end there. Wonder can become
excessive, and make us crave novelty simply for its own sake. Wonder
is only functional if it prompts us to resolve it in the satisfaction
of knowledge.</p>

<p>

Another distinctive passion Descartes describes is generosity
[<em>generosit&eacute;</em>], which produces a kind of self-directed
wonder, or esteem, grounded in our recognition &ldquo;that nothing
really belongs to us other than the free disposition of our
volitions,&rdquo; along with sensing &ldquo;in ourselves at the same
time a firm and constant resolution to use them well&rdquo; (AT XI
446, slightly altered from CSM I 384). It is this passion that seems
to be the keystone for &ldquo;the pursuit of
virtue,&rdquo; in particular because it &ldquo;serves as a remedy
against all the disorders of the passions&rdquo; (AT XI 447, CSM I
385). And although generosity is a perception directed at the self,
combining a knowledge of what is truly important in and for ourselves
with the will to act on the basis of that knowledge, it seems to
generate like esteem for others: generous people do good without
self-interest, are courteous, gracious and obliging, and live free
from contempt, jealousy, envy, hatred, fear and anger for others. The
key seems to be that generous people &ldquo;are entirely masters of
their passions&rdquo; (AT XI 448, modified from CSM I 385).</p>

<h3><a name="RemPas">7. The Remedy for the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

But Descartes does not think that passions should be eradicated
wholesale: they are the sources of &ldquo;the sweetest pleasures in
this life&rdquo; and &ldquo;are all good in their nature&rdquo; (AT XI
485, modified from CSM I 403) &ndash; with the possible exception of
terror. Indeed, since they are functional by nature, it is not
entirely clear why they should require remedy. True, like
sense-perceptions, they can misfunction under non-standard
circumstances. But unlike sense-perceptions, which give us material
for error when we take them at face value in our theoretical
reasonings, our passions do not seem to tempt us into thinking they
reflect the independent structure of the world. It may be that
Descartes holds that there is a conflict between the good for the
mind-body union (preservation) and the good for the soul alone. This
is something Malebranche insists on, and Descartes does allow that the
two goods may fail to coincide (e.g., joy is always good for the soul,
but not necessarily for the union). But his demand for mastery and
control seems to be motivated just as much by the practical concerns
of our embodied state. He identifies the control of the passions quite
generally with virtue, and virtue with happiness.  Perhaps though, the
need for a remedy arises from the mechanical causation governing the
physiology of the passions: it makes the passions simply too coarse to
steer us as precisely as they could with further correction of their
&ldquo;excesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

In any case, Descartes clearly allows that our passions, based as they
are on internal bodily dispositions to be moved by external objects,
can conflict with our rationally considered evaluations of those
objects &ndash; or what would be our evaluations, had we the time for
proper deliberation. The discipline of virtue averts such conflict by
allowing the soul to improve on untutored nature in its dealings with
its passions. The most important thing, Descartes tells us, is for the
soul to equip itself with &ldquo;firm and determinate judgments bearing upon
the knowledge of good and evil, which the soul has resolved to follow
in guiding its conduct&rdquo; (AT XI 367, CSM I 347). But this is just the
first step, for we should also alter our dispositions to feel the
passions, by way of a kind of internal bodily training generating new
and improved &ldquo;habits&rdquo; (AT XI 369, CSM I 348). What constitutes a
&ldquo;habit&rdquo; is a matter of some controversy: it might be like
the process of coming to perceive certain sounds as words, whereby we
produce novel, learned conjunctions of perceptions and movements in
the pineal gland. (This seems to be the view of Spinoza.) Or it might
be a matter of the sort of physiological changes that take place
during the training of hunting dogs, changes solely in body structure
and movements, e.g., alterations in the internal structure of the
brain and the subsequent coursing of the animal spirits. (This seems
to be the view of Malebranche.) (On this issue, see Hoffman 1991,
Shapiro 2003, and Schmitter 2005.)</p>

<h3><a name="InfIma">8. The Influence of the Imagination</a></h3>

<p>

The key to developing those habits that &ldquo;stop the bodily movements
which accompany&rdquo; certain passions seems to lie in the body,
particularly in the corporeal imagination (a part of the brain) and
its practices. Descartes notes that an effective way of countering an
undesirable passion is to imagine a new and different state of
affairs, or response to the state of affairs. The act of imagining
causes brain events, and so can serve as a voluntary, if indirect
means to change the course of the animal spirits and eliminate the
causes of some undesirable passion. More generally, entertaining any
thought at all, especially a clear and distinct thought that we cannot
help but affirm, carries an affective dimension that will in turn
prompt movements in the imagination and the passions. The long-term
consequences of such voluntary, imaginative practice is to reshape our
internal bodily &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; so that they produce
specific passions under the appropriate, rationally endorsed
circumstances.</p>

<p>

For these and other reasons, remedying the passions is closely related
to the maintenance of health. The discipline of virtue, in particular,
is presented as a kind of therapeutic and gymnastic regimen for the
soul, one that corrects its weaknesses and increases its strength. It
is a regimen whereby the soul harnesses the imagination and the body
in general to work on itself. <em>Mutatis mutandi</em>, controlling
the passions can have important consequences for bodily health.
Exercising control over the passions means that we are simultaneously
exercising control over the internal motions of the body &ndash; the
beatings of the heart, circulation of the blood and heat, the
disposition of the animal spirits, and so forth. It seems a fortunate
fact that the way reason directs us to shape our passions coincides
with the passionate production of healthful bodily movements (at least
if our bodies are in even minimally working order). This accord
between the education of the passions and the cultivation of health
may indeed be Descartes's trump card for his claim that the passions
are good by nature.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">9. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>

Of course, it is this picture of harmony between the soul and the
mind-body union and the prospect of complete mastery through resolute
practice that Elisabeth found implausibly rosy. Spinoza and
Malebranche will agree with her assessment, and each will &ndash; in
different ways &ndash; emphasize our dependence on what is out of our
control. But Descartes's project remained extremely important, shaping
the classificatory and explanatory apparatus of theories of the
emotions for the next century and a half. This is true even of those
who owed their main allegiances elsewhere, as was the case with the
neo-Epicurean Walter Charleton. Henry More simply inserted chunks of
the <em>Passions of the Soul</em> in his <em>Enchiridion ethicum</em>,
despite also appropriating bits and pieces from elsewhere (including
an odd version of the distinction between concupiscible and irascible
passions). Even ground-breaking philosophers felt his influence:
Descartes's taxonomy, for instance, clearly played a role in Hobbes's
account in the <em>Leviathan</em>, despite the very different
theoretical styles of the two philosophers. And Descartes's general
approach to the passions as functional remained a bone of contention
for generations to come, one fought over in rather different ways by
Hobbes, Malebranche and Spinoza.</p>
