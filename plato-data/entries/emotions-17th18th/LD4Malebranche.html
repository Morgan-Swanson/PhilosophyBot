<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>

Part V of Nicolas Malebranche's voluminous <em>Search after Truth</em>
(1674-5) is devoted entirely to the passions, while other parts treat
different kinds of affective states, such as the
&ldquo;inclinations&rdquo;. Malebranche freely acknowledges his debt to Descartes
here and elsewhere, but his treatment of the passions differs on at
least two counts: first is the emphasis on original sin and our fallen
nature, which shows Malebranche's affinity with Augustine and the
Augustinian revival of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Second is the
rejection of the Cartesian view granting priority to knowledge of our
own mind. Although we are capable of clear and distinct ideas through
the &ldquo;vision in God,&rdquo; Malebranche denies that direct
experience of our soul and its modifications provides such ideas. In
this way, he gives a very un-Cartesian twist to the Cartesian claim
that the passions of the soul (and similar perceptions) are
confused. Less important for our purposes is Malebranche's notorious
occasionalism, the view that genuine causal power belongs only to
God. We need simply to bear in mind that talk of &ldquo;natural
causes&rdquo; is shorthand for those states or events that are the
regular occasions for God to produce some effect.  (For disussion of
these topics, see the related entry
 <a href="../malebranche/">Malebranche</a>.)</p>

<h3><a name="ConStrPas">2. The Constitutive Structure of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

The <em>Search After Truth</em> V.3 identifies seven moments that
together make up the structure of the passions. First is a judgment, a
<em>perceived</em> judgment, of the relation an object has to us; this
judgment may be either distinct or confused. Next comes a
determination of the impulse of the will. Although clearly related to
the first, the two cannot be identified, since Malebranche does not
seem to think that a rational perception alone can be
motivating. Along with the judgment and determination of the will, we
also get an accompanying sensation. The main thing that allows us to
distinguish among passions is this sensation, insofar as it is a
sensation of, e.g., &ldquo;love, aversion, desire, joy, or
sadness&rdquo; (ST V.3, 348). Another element is bodily, a new
determination of the flow of the animal spirits and blood. Following
on the heels of these bodily changes is a sensible
&ldquo;emotion&rdquo; of the soul as it feels itself moved by the
unexpected flow of spirits. This, in turn, is followed by another
sensation, peculiar to the particular passion in question, caused by
the disturbances the animal spirits excite in the brain. Last is the
sensation of joy, or inner delight that accompanies all the
passions.</p>

<p>

Different passions may mobilize the elements of this structure
differently. For instance, Malebranche allows that passions may differ
because the first judgments differ, even if the associated emotions do
not (although that difference in judgment will produce correlative
changes in the third element, the sensation in the soul). In the case
of passions excited by confused sensations, the first three elements
(the judgment, the inclination of the will, and the accompanying
sensation) may be missing. The imperfect passion of wonder
[<em>admiration</em>] lacks even more of the elements typical of other
passions. Despite concessions to such truncated passions, the
complicated and variable internal constitution of the passions allows
Malebranche to adopt a holistic account in which the passions can be
finely differentiated.  However, the main principle of taxonomy is the
relation the passion supposes between the object and us.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPas">3. The Classification of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

Malebranche's taxonomy does not seem completely consistent, but in
V.7, he declares that the two parent passions are love and hatred
&ndash; although love is primary for various reasons described
below. These produce three &ldquo;general&rdquo; passions of desire,
joy and sadness, e.g., there can be desiderative love, joyful love and
melancholy love. But Malebranche also throws wonder into the mix,
calling it a passion that precedes all the others. He characterizes
wonder in ways reminiscent of Descartes: it involves no judgment
evaluating our relation to the object, and it doesn't dispose the body
towards action, since it produces no agitation in the nerves leading
to the heart. It can be useful to science, prompting us to discover
and learn new truths, although it can also malfunction.  Despite
including all six of what Descartes considered the
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions, the rest of Malebranche's taxonomy
differs a good deal from Descartes's, as can be seen in the principles
of classification offered in V.10. Love and hate may produce different
species modified by desire, joy and sadness, but here Malebranche
tells us that all passions can be reduced to the three
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions of desire, joy and sadness, combined
with different judgments about the passions' objects. Some passions
don't reduce to just one, but contain an emotion mixed of almost equal
parts of two or more of the primitive passions, even mixtures of such
seemingly opposed passions as joy and sadness. Wonder too can be
divided into various species of, e.g., esteem, self-esteem, or pride,
veneration, scorn, and humility.</p>

<h3><a name="FunPas">4. The Functions of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

Malebranche follows Descartes in maintaining that the passions are
inherently functional for the union of mind and body, by teaching us
what will preserve the body. Passions are in us, Malebranche
maintains, because we have an essential relation to our bodies. The
natural cause of the passions is the body, more specifically, the
movement of animal spirits. The passions themselves are located in the
will (although as we have seen, they contain components of various
kinds). Thus, they are impulses or inclinations, comparable in some
respects to what Malebranche calls &ldquo;natural inclinations,&rdquo;
which are also affective and willful. But natural inclinations do not
have their (natural, occasional) causes in the body, and occur even in
pure intelligences, such as the angels. In fact, the natural
inclinations proper to minds alone seem to be a condition for our
disposition to experience the passions. The ultimate precondition,
however, is God's will: our passions are confused traces of God's love
for himself. So Malebranche takes love to be the primary impulse
driving all the passions. He does not, however, adopt the fully
Augustinian position of reducing all passions to love. Since sensible
pain is a real evil, and not simply a privation of good, there can be
a genuine object of aversion. But if we are not fleeing pain, then
aversion does reduce to love, to the pursuit of some good or other.
More generally, our very capacity to experience passions is explained
by their function in inclining us toward loving our bodies and all
that might be useful for their preservation. Malebranche extends this
functional explanation even to the natural causes of the passions:
those movements &ldquo;of the animal spirits that are dispersed
throughout the body in order to produce and maintain in it a
disposition appropriate to the object we perceive, so that the mind
and body might be of mutual help in dealing with it&rdquo; (ST V.1,
338).  For this reason, the operation of the passions, even of
aversive passions such as sadness, is always accompanied by a feeling
of &ldquo;inner delight,&rdquo; a reflection that the body is in the
proper state vis-&agrave;-vis the object.</p>

<p>

Malebranche, however, takes the good that the passions serve to be a
limited good; it is a good only for the mind-body union, not one of
the goods for the soul alone (see Greenberg 2010). Moreover, the
corruption that is our lot after the Fall affects our experience of
the passions.  Whereas Adam could feel the passions at will, we often
find ourselves at the mercy of the passions, and thereby torn from the
greater good of God. This is because we are not merely joined, but
subjugated to our bodies &ndash; and through our bodies, to our
&ldquo;relatives, friends, city, prince, country, clothes, house,
land, horse, dog, to the entire earth, the sun, the stars, to all the
heavens&rdquo; (ST V.  2, 342). Since union with God is the greatest
of all goods, we should fight against the influence of the passions,
even against the love that joins us more firmly to our bodies, and
seek the separation required to devote ourselves to the good of the
mind. As Malebranche puts it, the passions belong to &ldquo;the order
of nature,&rdquo; and are well-ordered only if considered in relation
to the preservation of the body. Even then, they may sometimes mislead
us, although such cases are fortunately rare.</p>

<h3><a name="RolGraCorPas">5. The Role of Grace in Correcting the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

It is no easy task to overcome the influence of the passions in our
corrupted state. The passions do not obey our rational will, and the
inner delight that accompanies the operation of the passions makes for
genuine discomfort if we struggle against their promptings. Here
Malebranche's view of how the Fall corrupted a battery of natural
dispositions and inclinations that were inherently functional produces
multiple evaluations of the role of pleasures and pains. This is
reflected in his criticisms of previous theories of the emotions. The
Epicureans were at fault for identifying the good with sensible
pleasure (no matter how moderate and long-lasting that pleasure might
be). But neither does the Stoic ideal of <em>apatheia</em> offer a
satisfactory alternative, for it is simply implausible. Instead,
Malebranche holds <em>both</em> that we have a duty to struggle
against the delight that the passions afford in the name of a higher
good, <em>and</em> that &ldquo;there is no felicity without
pleasure&rdquo; (ST V.4, 361). Were all else equal, pleasure would be
good, and we simply cannot conceive of a happiness that does not
include pleasure and pleasurable affects. But all else is not
equal. The problem with the views of both Epicureans and Stoics
&ndash; and indeed even of such a nominally Christian author as
Descartes &ndash; is that they see no need for Grace to overcome the
dysfunctional wages of original sin. We can (and should) struggle
against the passions, but Grace is required to restore the balance of
power within our natures. It does so by providing us with a sensible
delight in following reason and in the intellectual love of God, which
will outweigh the discomfort of resisting the passions. </p>

<h3><a name="PasErr">6. The Passions and Error</a></h3>

<p>

However, Malebranche's topic in the <em>The Search After Truth</em> is
not moral philosophy, but the methods for improving our attempts to
discover the truth. The passions are simply not suited to pursuing
this good; they tend to lead us into intellectual error, and so it is
important to correct their influence. Following Descartes, Malebranche
compares passions to sensations, and suggests that they offer a
comparable opportunity for error by tempting us to attribute qualities
belonging only to the subjective perceiving to the objects of those
perceptions. The kinds of qualities we project are quite different in
each case, but both involve projecting something peculiar to the
interaction of mind and object onto the object alone. The passions
also tempt us to errors of over-generalization: we may over-generalize
about the objects of our passions, as when my hate for something makes
me overlook even its good qualities; we may over-generalize about the
dispositions of other humans, as when I assume that others tend to
feel the same passions I do; and we may over-generalize about objects
related to the objects of our passions, as when I groundlessly extend
my dislike for some person to his friends and relations. In describing
these sorts of errors, Malebranche adopts something of an
associationist psychology, and his analysis foreshadows Hume's
analysis of prejudices. The passionate stance taken toward one object
spreads to whatever might be associated in any number of ways with
that thing. Unlike Hume, Malebranche does not offer specific
principles of association, but he does offer a physiological
explanation of the &ldquo;spread.&rdquo; Passions invigorate the flow
of animal spirits through the brain just as the traces representing
the object are called up. Because of their vigor, the spirits are
likely to overflow to nearby, related traces of objects (association
is here understood in terms of the proximity of brain traces), which
then come along for the recollective ride. And so the &ldquo;dominant
passions&rdquo; we feel will color our thinking about a wide range of
objects. Malebranche attributes all sorts of theoretical errors,
fashions, and factionalism (including what he clearly considers an
irrational preference for scholastic philosophy) to the prejudices
generated by such passionate overflow. </p>

<p>

The influence of the passions is not all bad. Wonder can be useful for
the sciences, just because of the vigor with which it stirs up the
various animal spirits, and thereby allows us to fix our attention and
retain things in memory. We may indeed need to call on the passion of
wonder as a strategy in the pursuit of science, for instance by
imagining something as novel (even more novel than it really is). But
wonder can also malfunction, producing not learning, but stupefaction.
Indeed, Malebranche takes the mistaken veneration felt for the ancient
philosophers to rest in no small part on the way artists are wont to
depict each as possessing &ldquo;a huge head with a broad and high
forehead and a magnificently full beard&rdquo; (ST V.7, 383). And other
passions that &ldquo;involve the heart&rdquo; more, and thereby
dispose the body for action, can be yet more prejudicial to our
interests. In particular, Malebranche declares that hatred and dread
are the passions most damaging both to our reason and to civil
society.</p>

<p>

Malebranche insists time and time again that &ldquo;all the passions
seek their own justification&rdquo; (ST V.11, 399). That is, they tend
to maintain themselves through a kind of feedback loop that includes
the production of judgments that accord with the passion and sustain
it: cheerful passions will produce judgments that all is right in the
world, whereas dread encourages judgments with the opposite
character. Because they offer an alternative source for judgments, the
passions can compete with our intellect and override its verdicts.
Moreover, the passions draw support from other passions; they
&ldquo;cooperate among themselves,&rdquo; producing self-sustaining
complexes and trains of passion:</p>

<blockquote>

desire is animated by love, strengthened by hope, increased by joy,
renewed by dread, accompanied by courage, envy, anger, and several
other passions that in turn form an infinite variety of judgments that
succeed one another and sustain the desire giving birth to them. (ST
V.11, 402) </blockquote>

<h3><a name="InfImaPas">7. The Influence of the Imagination on the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

The support the passions afford each other is largely a matter of the
relations among the judgments generated by each passion, which can
overwhelm the few resources available to the intellect to combat them.
For this reason, intervening in the formation of those judgments can
undermine the self-seeking justifications of the passions. Although he
is not sanguine about our chances, Malebranche recommends that our
best strategy is to recruit allies for the intellect, particularly by
enlisting the imagination. Chapter V.8 describes how the passions stir
up the animal spirits and leave brain traces that are not under
the soul's command,so that &ldquo; the passions, then, act on the imagination, and
the imagination thus corrupted combats reason by continually
representing things to it not as they are in themselves&rdquo; (ST
V.11, 402). But the imagination itself stands &ndash; to some extent
&ndash; under the control of the mind, and is, in fact, &ldquo;the
only means the soul has of arresting the effects of its
passions&rdquo; (ST V.3, 351). The imagination is a bodily faculty,
with physiological connections to the opening and contracting of the
nerves that determine the flow of spirits and humors. That is a
connection we can use and modify, for instance, by forming imaginative
pictures to accompany various thoughts, including abstract
thoughts. Now, even purely abstract thoughts may produce
&ldquo;inclinations in the soul,&rdquo; e.g., thinking of truth,
virtue, or God can produce an inclination of love. And inclinations of
the soul (even those not directly related to the body) have bodily
effects; in particular, they produce disturbances in the animal
spirits. The imagination, however, adds a strong extra impetus to
those effects. Actively deploying the imagination, then, can generate
the entire train of sensations and emotions typical of that passion we
deem appropriate, namely the passion in accord with the soul's natural
inclinations. We can also resist the pernicious influences of the
imagination caused by recalcitrant passions through techniques of
association. Training ourselves to associate some thought with
whatever arouses our passion, we can redirect the accompanying bodily
movements as we see fit. Doing so repeatedly produces a habituation
that changes our dispositions for actions and passions.  None of these
tricks obviate the need for Grace, but they are useful stopgap
measures.</p>

<h3><a name="SocChaPas">8. The Social Character of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>

Just as the passions exhibit and produce dependence on the body, so
too do they exhibit and produce social relations and interdependence
on others. For the train of the passions does not stop at the limits
of an individual body, but is communicated between individuals. A
passion in one individual will produce facial expressions and other
sensible bodily effects &ndash; bearing, changes of color, words,
cries, and the like. Perceiving these outer symptoms of the passions
powerfully affects the imagination of other humans (and animals), and
thence rouses their passions. The communication of passions across
populations is a crucial bit of glue holding civil society
together. But it can also threaten social order.</p>

<p>

Malebranche adopts the same attitude towards the communication of the
passions that he showed towards the passions individually: they are
basically functional. For one, he takes it that the passions so
reproduced are usually sociable: &ldquo;passions that move us mainly
in order to link us to all sensible things for the preservation of
society and of our sensible being&rdquo; (ST V.7, 377). In particular,
expressions of distress produce passions in others that disturb and
interest them in the person's preservation (ST V.3, 348-9). Even
wonder can serve a social purpose: Malebranche interprets the behavior
of small dogs in the presence of a larger dog as expressions of wonder
that work toward their self-preservation. Malebranche also assumes
that the passions produce like passions in others &ndash; that their
communication is a communication of like to like. (This is a point
made frequently in ancient rhetoric). As such, the communication of
passions serves to join &ldquo;men together in relation to good and
evil and [make] them exactly like one another not only in their mental
disposition but also in the condition of their body&rdquo; (ST V.7,
377). But although it usually greases the wheels of human interaction,
the social communication of passions can also exacerbate their
detrimental aspects, e.g., by allowing the passion-induced errors of
one person to be replicated across an entire population. </p>

<p>

However, the communication and liability to passions is not completely
uniform. Malebranche suggests that the disposition to feel various
passions will vary across differences in &ldquo;sexes and ages,&rdquo;
as well as characters, &ldquo;occupations and stations in life.&rdquo;
The reasons for this variation are both physiological and
social-psychological. Malebranche holds that people of different ages,
sexes, and temperaments (e.g., melancholics) will show differences in
the &ldquo;construction of the brain's fibers as well as the agitation
and amount of spirits and blood.&rdquo; Differences in such
construction will clearly alter which passions one will feel, and what
the effects of a passion will be. But so too do the associations we
form affect the dispositions to feel passions towards certain things.
These associations are psychological, but are shaped by social
position. Thus, &ldquo;great men&rdquo; depend on more things than
other people do, and their slavery is of greater extent (see James
2005, and for a contrast, Schmitter 2010). In contrast, women are
likely to be involved only with family and neighborhood, and so won't
be as liable to passions directed at an entire nation.  But the
passions they do feel may be stronger, just because of their narrow
scope.</p>

<h3><a name="PasCauCon">9. Passions, Causation and Consciousness</a></h3>

<p>

Malebranche emphasizes that the communication of passions takes place
through purely mechanical means. Each step is mechanical, starting
with how a passion produces bodily expressions. Fear may make our
faces blanch, our hearts race, and our knees knock together, but these
are simply the effects of the movements of the blood and animal
spirits that are part of the passion. So too may the perception of
these expressions strike the imagination and initiate a series of
bodily changes in the observer, culminating in some passion. But these
effects are simply the result of the design of the
machine. Malebranche takes it that this explains why we may be
completely unaware of many or most of these effects, even as they
occur within us. </p>

<p>

In general, Malebranche denies that the experience of the passions (or
indeed any perceptions) is transparent to itself: &ldquo;not all our
passions are accompanied by some awareness on the mind's part &hellip;
we often feel moved by some passion without knowing it and sometimes
even without feeling its cause&rdquo; (ST V.12, 407).  Malebranche
here seems most struck by the possibility that we do not know the
cause of our passions &ndash; a point familiar from Descartes.  But he
also acknowledges that we may feel a passion without knowing what it
is; even an occurrent passion may be &lsquo;an I-know-not-what moves
me.&rsquo; Passions seem most likely to be opaque when we feel them
unreflectively, through mere association. Malebranche takes such
association to operate as does the mechanical causation found in
bodily events, especially where there are &ldquo;secret alliances with
the present disposition of our body&rdquo; (ST V.12, 407). In this
way, he links a lack of full accessibility to consciousness with
mechanical causation in an associationist psychology. </p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">10. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>

Although now somewhat overshadowed by other seventeenth-century
continental philosophers, Malebranche's influence on early modern
thought was enormous. This is particularly the case in British
philosophy, which saw an important group of English Malebrancheans
arise in the late seventeenth century (Norris, 1688), while the
British Empiricists used him as their favorite examplar of a
&ldquo;rationalist. &rdquo; Nowhere is the extent of Malebranche's
influence more obvious than in his treatment of the passions: not only
did his general proto-associationist and imagination-based psychology
and its extension to the social communication of affects shape the
thought of several generations of eighteenth century British
philosophers, but his particular accounts of the passion of love, and
even of why we take pleasure in tragic drama were adopted almost
wholesale by several authors (Norris and Astell, 1695, and cf. Masham,
1696). Some similar views can also be found in such contemporaries as
Spinoza and Pascal.  But Malebranche seems one of the main conduits
through which these thoughts were received by British philosophers,
making him a force to be reckoned with in understanding the origins of
18th century British empiricist psychology and moral philosophy.</p>
