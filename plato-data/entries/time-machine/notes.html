<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Time Machines</a></h2>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 For a sampling of the physics literature on time machines, see 
Hawking (1992a, b), Krasnikov (1999, 2002, 2014b), Morris and Thorne (1988),
Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever (1988), Visser (2003). For a sampling 
of the popular and semi-popular literature, see Davies (2002a, b), 
Gott (2001), Hawking (2001), and Nahin (1999).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 See Arntzenius and Maudlin (2009) for a detailed discussion of the 
physics of time travel. We find, not without satisfaction, some 
indications in the recent philosophical literature that the logical 
and physical possibilities of time travel are more widely accepted 
than they were ten years ago. Recent attempts to argue for the 
compatibility of certain philosophical positions, such as presentism 
(cf. Keller and Nelson 2001; Monton 2003), with the possibility of 
time travel bear testimony of this development.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 It is important to emphasize that since CTCs are always 
future-directed curves, the phenomenon at stake does not involve 
&ldquo;backward causation&rdquo; where the effect precedes its cause:
at least locally, causation in the kind of time travel considered 
here is always &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; i.e., parallel to the direction
of time.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 The reader familiar with the physics literature will have noticed 
that many authors employ the concept of a time machine without due 
diligence. Often, they merely equate time machines with the presence 
of CTCs. Less frequently, they use it to designate spacetime 
constructions, such as wormholes, which exhibit physically realized 
CTCs. This supports our insistence on the utility of philosophical 
analysis in improving conceptual rigor.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 Our take on this matter can be found in Earman et al. (2009). We 
argue that the notion of consistency constraint only makes sense when
fields are propagated on a <em>fixed</em> spacetime background, which
is contrary to the spirit of general relativity theory.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 See Earman (1999) for an account of how these theorems came to be.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 A relativistic spacetime 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is <em>temporally 
orientable</em> iff there exists a continuous everywhere defined 
timelike vector field on 
 \(\mathcal{M}\). If such a field exists, reversing the
arrows gives another such field. The choice of one of these fields as
&ldquo;pointing the way to the future&rdquo; is what is meant by the 
assignment of a time orientation.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 In this context, a (double) <em>covering spacetime</em> of a 
spacetime 
 \(\mathcal{M}\) may be defined as the set of all pairs
\((p, \alpha)\) where \(p \in \mathcal{M}\) and \(\alpha\) encodes one of the two 
temporal orientations at \(p\). A projection \(\pi : (p, 
\alpha) \rightarrow p\) maps events of the covering spacetime back
into 
 \(\mathcal{M}\). Locally, this projection must be a 
diffeomorphism in order for the covering spacetime to inherit the 
local differential structure of 
 \(\mathcal{M}\). In case the double covering spacetime
consists of two disparate parts, there exist two different, globally 
consistent assignments of a temporal orientation and 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is time-orientable. 
If the covering spacetime is connected, there exist smooth 
transitions from one time orientation to the other and vice versa. 
This implies that 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is not 
time-orientable, but that the covering spacetime is. Cf. Hawking and 
Ellis (1973), section 6.1.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 G&ouml;del spacetime does not possess a single global time slice. 
This follows from the facts that G&ouml;del spacetime is simply 
connected, that it is time orientable, and that through each point of
the spacetime there is a CTC.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 If a spacetime possesses a global time slice \(\Sigma\), then \(\Sigma\) 
can be turned into a partial Cauchy surface by passing to a covering 
spacetime which &ldquo;unwinds&rdquo; the future directed timelike 
curves that intersect \(\Sigma\) more than once in the original 
spacetime. Cf. Hawking and Ellis (1973), pp. 204f.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 A standard result about general relativistic spacetimes shows that if
\(V \ne \varnothing\), then \(V\) comprises an open subset of 
 \(\mathcal{M}\).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 The <em>future domain of dependence</em> 
\(D^+ (S)\) of a spacetime region \(S \subseteq \mathcal{M}\) is defined as consisting of all those 
spacetime points \(p\) such that every past endless causal curve
through \(p\) meets \(S\). If \(p \not\in D^+ (S)\) then there are possible causal 
processes which can affect the state of \(p\) but which do not 
register on \(S\). The past domain of dependence 
\(D^- (S)\) of \(S\) is defined 
analogously. The total domain of dependence \(D(S)\) of
\(S\) is \(D^- (S) \cup\) 
D\(^+ (S)\). For a general discussion of causal 
determinism, see Hoefer (2003).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 More precisely, \(H^+ (S)\) for an achronal 
set \(S \subset \mathcal{M}\) is defined as <span 
style="text-decoration:overline;">\(D^+ (S)\)</span>
\(- I^- (D^+ (S))\), 
where the overbar denotes the topological closure in 
 \(\mathcal{M}\) and 
\(I^- (X)\) denotes the chronological 
past of \(X\), i.e., the set of all points \(p \in \mathcal{M}\) such that there is a past directed 
timelike curve from \(X\) to \(p\).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 Theorem 8.3.5 of Wald (1984) shows that for an achronal set 
\(S\), every point \(p \in H^+ (S)\) lies on a null geodesic contained 
within \(H^+ (S)\) which is either past 
inextendible or else has a past endpoint on the edge of \(S\). 
In the case here concerned, \(S\) is a global time slice and, 
thus, has no edges.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 Deutsch-Politzer spacetime in its original form, i.e., without the 
conformal doctoring as discussed in the subsequent paragraph, is due 
to Deutsch (1991) and Politzer (1992).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 That is, there are geodesics that cannot be extended to indefinitely 
large values of an affine parameter. In fact, Deutsch-Politzer 
spacetime is timelike, spacelike, and null geodesically incomplete. 
Although there is no generally agreed upon criterion for singular 
relativistic spacetimes, geodesic incompleteness is generally 
accepted as a sufficient condition.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 More precisely, <em>strong causality</em> is violated at a point 
\(p\) of spacetime 
 \(\mathcal{M}\) if there is a neighborhood of 
\(p \in \mathcal{M}\) such that every subneighborhood has 
the property that some causal curve intersects it more than once. It 
follows from Proposition 6.4.7 of Hawking and Ellis (1973, 195) that 
strong causality cannot hold on a compact set \(S \subset \mathcal{M}\) if a past inextendible causal curve is
imprisoned within \(S\).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 In more detail, this condition requires that the stress-energy tensor
\(T_{ab}\), which describes the distribution of 
matter-energy, satisfies 
\(T_{ab}V^a V^b \ge 0\) for all 
timelike vectors \(V^a\). In the case of perfect fluid
with energy density \(\mu\) and pressure \(p\), this requirement is
satisfied iff \(\mu \ge\) and \(\mu + p \ge 0\). Obviously, in 
the vacuum case \((T_{ab} \equiv 0)\) the weak energy 
condition is automatically satisfied. See Wald (1984, 218&ndash;220) for 
more details on the energy conditions.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 For an illustrative example, see the cut-and-paste construction in 
Hawking and Ellis (1973, 58f). The resulting spacetime is maximal but
not hole free. To rule out such examples Hawking and Ellis employ the
requirement that a physically acceptable spacetime 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) be <em>locally 
inextendible</em>, i.e., there is no open subset \(U \subset \mathcal{M}\) with non-compact closure in 
 \(\mathcal{M}\) such that the sub-spacetime 
\((U, g|_U )\) affords an extension 
\((U', g')\) in which the closure of the 
isometric image of \(U\) is compact. Unfortunately, this 
requirement is too strong: it fails for Minkowski spacetime!</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 The uniqueness proof for solutions to the initial value problem for 
Einstein&rsquo;s field equations contains an &ldquo;up to 
diffeomorphism&rdquo; proviso. The reader familiar with 
Einstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;hole argument&rdquo; will appreciate the 
significance of this proviso; see Norton (2008). We ignore these 
issues since they are not relevant to present concerns.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
 An achronal spacelike hypersurface \(S\) is said to be a 
<em>Cauchy surface</em> for a spacetime 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) iff 
\(D(S) = \mathcal{M}\).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 The existence of a Cauchy surface for a spacetime 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is equivalent to the 
requirement of <em>global hyperbolicity</em>, which is the 
conjunction of two conditions: (i) 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is strongly causal at
every point \(p \in \mathcal{M}\), and (ii) \(J^+(p) \cap
J^-(q)\) is compact for all \(p, q \in \mathcal{M}\). If CTCs are 
present then, obviously, global hyperbolicity fails.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 A weaker form of cosmic censorship requires only that any naked 
singularities that develop from regular initial data are hidden 
behind the event horizons of black holes. For a recent review of the 
prospects of cosmic censorship, see Wald (1998).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 That quantum fields violate the weak energy condition is irrelevant 
to the present context, which is classical general relativity theory.
It does, however, become relevant to the discussion of the following 
section.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 For other expressions of doubt about the status of the condition that
\(H^+ (\Sigma_0)\) is compactly generated, 
see Ori (1993) and Krasnikov (1999).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 Actually, it is the renormalized stress-energy tensor that is used in
calculating backreaction effects; see below.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 The Unruh and Hawking effects, though closely related, are different.
For an authoritative account, see Wald (1994).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 For a review of loop quantum gravity, see Rovelli (2004). For string 
theory there is little in the middle ground between popularizations 
(e.g. Greene 1999) and formidably technical treatises. But Zwiebach 
(2004) is a reasonably accessible text.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 For overviews of these results, see Visser (2003).</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 This is the so-called <em>Hadamard condition</em>, which demands that
the two-point correlation function for the quantum field is of what 
is called the Hadamard form.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
 For a review of the causal set approach with the relevant references,
see Brightwell et al. (2003). A set is called <em>causal</em> iff it 
is endowed with a binary relation which is transitive, acyclic, and 
past-finite, i.e., each element has a finite number of elements to 
its past. This relation is interpreted as capturing relations of 
causal precedence and thus as encoding the causal structure of 
spacetime at the scale of Planck.</p> 

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
 &ldquo;Suggests&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;implies&rdquo; because the 
theorem requires the construction of a bijection between the elements
of the causal set and the points of the spacetime manifold to be 
emulated. Malament (1977) shows how this bijection, if it preserves 
the causal structure, and if both the set and the spacetime are 
future- and past-distinguishing, also preserves the topological and 
therefore the metrical structure. A spacetime 
 \((\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\) is <em>future- (or 
past-) distinguishing</em> iff for all \(p\) in 
 \(\mathcal{M}\) and for all open neighborhoods of 
\(p\), there exists an open subset of the neighborhood which 
contains \(p\) such that no future- (or past-) directed curve 
through \(p\) which leaves the subset ever returns to it. Thus, 
a future-distinguishing spacetime cannot contain CTCs.</p>
