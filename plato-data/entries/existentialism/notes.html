<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Existentialism</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  Some (e.g., MacIntyre
1967:153) have found this interest in producing a systematic account
of existence incompatible with the basic tenor of existentialism,
which is supposed to be anti-rational, anti-intellectual, a matter of
passion, feeling, and literary rhetoric.  But while Kierkegaard and
Nietzsche did attack the complacent academic philosophy of their time,
the latter, at least, offered positive views of his own. And while
later existentialists did call into question the exclusive right of
logical argumentation in philosophical method, championing
phenomenological description as equally necessary, it is far too
simplistic to identify the essence of existentialism with these
elements of protest and to reduce its characteristic theses to the
short-sightedness of &ldquo;a dissappointed rationalism&rdquo;
(MacIntyre 1967:152).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>  Husserl developed the
phenomenological method by means of an eidetic reduction&mdash;in
which the philosopher was to reflect not on some particular
intentional experience (such as perception) but the
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; or universal structure exhibited by it&mdash;and
by means of an
<em>epoch&eacute;</em>, or bracketing of the reality of the world in
order to study its pure (and, Husserl claimed, immanent) givenness as a
correlate of consciousness. To various degrees, the existentialists
rejected these aspects of Husserl's method, and the doctrine of the
transcendental ego associated with them (see Cooper 1999:46-54; Zaner
and Ihde 1973:11-26), holding that they undermined the true
significance of the discovery of intentionality. As Merleau-Ponty
(1962:xiv) famously wrote: &ldquo;The most important lesson which the
reduction teaches us is the impossibility of a complete reduction.&rdquo; The
relation between transcendental and existential phenomenology is,
however, quite complex and remains in dispute. See, for a variety of
views, Cooper (1999), Spiegelberg (1984:436-40), Dreyfus and Haugeland
(1978:222-38), Crowell (2001), Natanson (1968).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  In fact, many of
Kierkegaard's works were not written under his own name but as
authored by a series of <em>personae</em>, or pseudonyms, which makes
the attribution of particular views in his texts to
&ldquo;Kierkegaard&rdquo; problematic. Indeed, this strategy of
&ldquo;indirect communication&rdquo; was tied to the existential
themes that Kierkegaard sought to highlight in his dialectical
writings, but we shall ignore these complications here. For a good
discussion of Kierkegaard's pseudonymous authorship, see Hannay (1982)
and Hannay in Crowell (2012).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  Sartre's slogan derives
from a sentence in Heidegger's <em>Being and Time</em>: &ldquo;Das
&lsquo;Wesen&rsquo; des Daseins liegt in seiner Existenz,&rdquo; which
Macquarrie and Robinson translate, &ldquo;The &lsquo;essence&rsquo; of
Dasein lies in its existence&rdquo; (Heidegger 1962:67). In 1946
Heidegger maintained that Sartre had totally misunderstood the meaning
of the claim (Heidegger 1998:250), but certainly <em>some</em> of what
Sartre develops from it can be found in Heidegger too. For the latter,
the question of existence is not first of all a philosophical one but
rather the question raised by any human being: &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo;
The fact that we raise such a question is not, for Heidegger, an
accidental feature of our psychology but an essential feature of our
being: I am such that &ldquo;in [my] very being that being is
an <em>issue</em> for [me]&rdquo; (Heidegger 1962:32). A
<em>philosophical</em> inquiry into existence, then, is a kind of
meta-inquiry into &ldquo;that which one inquires into when one asks
the question &lsquo;Who?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Heidegger 1962:79). This, in
turn, leads him to distinguish sharply between
&ldquo;categories&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>existentialia</em>&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., between the
philosophical concepts used to characterize entities that answer to a
&ldquo;what&rdquo; question and those that answer to a
&ldquo;who&rdquo; question: &ldquo;<em>Existentialia</em> and
categories are the two basic possibilities for characters of
being. The entities which correspond to them require different kinds
of primary interrogation respectively: any entity is either a
&lsquo;who&rsquo; (existence) or a &lsquo;what&rsquo; &hellip;&rdquo;
(Heidegger 1962:71).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  Heidegger himself is
quite clear on the point that at a certain formal level he is
presenting a theory of the &ldquo;essential structures&rdquo; that
pertain to existence (Dasein): By means of phenomenological inquiry
&ldquo;there are certain structures which we shall exhibit&mdash;not
just any accidental structures, but essential ones which, in every
kind of being that factical Dasein may possess, persist as
determinative for the character of its being&rdquo; (Heidegger
1962:38). Such an aim&mdash;which could also be found in every
existential philosopher who draws upon the resources of
phenomenology&mdash;belongs to the very character of philosophy as a
reflective and general inquiry. But the search for &ldquo;essential
structures&rdquo; in this sense does not undermine the distinction
between the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and the &ldquo;who,&rdquo; and thus
the <em>character</em> of these essential structures will have to be
understood differently in each case. As Heidegger puts it:
&ldquo;Accordingly, those characteristics which can be exhibited in
this entity are not &lsquo;properties' present-at-hand of some entity
which &lsquo;looks' so and so and is itself present-at-hand; they are
in each case possible ways for it to be, and no more than that&rdquo;
(Heidegger 1962:67).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>  The fact that the
category&mdash;natural, social, etc.&mdash;to which these features
belong can be disputed is irrelevant; indeed, even what these features
are is not decisive, since &ldquo;facticity&rdquo; as such is simply
whatever aspect of my being lies beyond the scope of my freedom: the
given. It is for the empirical sciences, not existential philosophy,
to say what these features are, and such empirical work will always
remain a matter of dispute. For instance, are &ldquo;race&rdquo; and
&ldquo;belief&rdquo; really concepts that capture some given aspect of
myself? This does not mean, however, that existential philosophers
have not tried to offer more robust theories of facticity&mdash;for
instance, Sartre's appropriation of Marx's emphasis on economic
categories, or Merleau-Ponty's attempt to develop an ontology of
&ldquo;flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>  Heidegger (1962:85)
diagnoses the reason for our tendency to think this way in his notion
of &ldquo;falling&rdquo;: our practical absorption in the world leads
to a kind of self-forgetfulness in which we think of ourselves in
terms of what we have most to do with, namely, in terms of things.
&ldquo;Dasein&hellip;gets its ontological understanding of itself in
the first instance from those entities which it itself is <em>not</em>
but which it encounters &lsquo;within&rsquo; its world, and from the
being which they possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>  It should be noted that
some existentialists, such as Jaspers, use the term
&ldquo;transcendence&rdquo; in a different sense, to refer to the
&ldquo;Encompassing,&rdquo; the whole that lies beyond the ordinary,
the mundane, and the reach of empirical science. For Jaspers
(1968:60-61), this leads to a strongly normative use of the
term <em>Existenz</em> as &ldquo;the Encompassing, not in the sense of
the vastness of a horizon of all horizons, but rather in the sense of
a fundamental origin, the condition of selfhood without which all the
vastness of being becomes a desert.&rdquo; As Jaspers uses the
term, <em>Existenz</em> corresponds most closely to what existential
philosophers typically call <em>authentic</em> existence, while what
they refer to as &ldquo;inauthentic existence&rdquo; does not count as
<em>Existenz</em> at all for Jaspers. On authentic existence, see
below.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  This irreducible duality
in the self makes possible what Sartre (1992:86-116) calls &ldquo;bad
faith,&rdquo; a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce
excuses bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself,
identifying itself entirely with facticity. When it becomes necessary
to elude what it has made of itself, however, it then adopts the
first-person agent's perspective, identifying itself entirely with
transcendence, where all is &ldquo;possibility.&rdquo; In neither case
can the deception fully succeed&mdash;it is a &ldquo;metastable&rdquo;
structure that will inevitably collapse into anguish. But as Sartre
points out, without these two facets of existence&mdash;i.e., if
consciousness was the simple &ldquo;I think&rdquo; that the tradition
took it to be&mdash;it would be impossible to explain how the
very <em>project</em> of self-deception could be entertained.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  Sartre (1992:90-94)
argues that the Freudian theory of the unconscious is based on an
incoherent view of consciousness, but he embraces the project of
psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the &ldquo;fundamental
project&rdquo; of an individual's life. For a brief example of how
this works, see his
<em>Baudelaire</em>. In general, it is at this point that
existentialism makes contact with the tradition of hermeneutics and the
<em>Verstehen</em> tradition in the human sciences. This becomes
especially explicit in Sartre's later elaboration of his
&ldquo;progressive-regressive method&rdquo; in <em>Search for a Method</em>. (See
especially Sartre 1968:132-162). See also Ludwig Binswanger's concept
of &ldquo;Dasein-analysis&rdquo; as a method in psychoanalysis, and, finally, the
hermeneutic reading of Freud offered by Paul Ricoeur in his <em>Freud
and Philosophy</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  In <em>Fear and
Trembling</em> Kierkegaard made a similar point when he argued that
Abraham had to remain &ldquo;silent&rdquo; about his act&mdash;not in
order to spare Sarah's or Isaac's feelings (indeed, ethically,
according to Kierkegaard, he was required to speak), but because he
could not say anything intelligible. His &ldquo;act&rdquo; was
singular, not part of a practice that could ever be made public, and
hence could not, strictly speaking, be understood, even as a
&ldquo;deviation&rdquo; from normal ethical behavior.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> On the other hand, to
the extent that character is seen as an unreflective source of my
behavior, it will always be in tension with the idea of
authenticity. In general, the relation between authenticity and a
theory of the virtues is important and under-studied. Can one, for
instance, be inauthentically courageous? Can I engage in
&ldquo;courageous&rdquo; acts in the right circumstances, for the
right reasons, and so on, and still do them &ldquo;as one
does&rdquo;&mdash;that is, without drawing these behaviors back to my
first-person choice of myself in the world, a commitment to being a
courageous person?</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  Sartre (1992) adds a
characteristic twist to this idea: the dual structure of human
existence (facticity/transcendence) brings with it, formally, a kind
of meta-project of doing justice simultaneously to both sides so that
their opposing claims&mdash;being such as to have a fixed and stable
identity while also being such as to be free&mdash;are united
authentically in one being. Such a being, says Sartre, is what we
imagine God to be. But what authenticity (self-transparency) reveals
is the impossibility of such a project ever succeeding. Hence at a
basic level all human projects contain an element of
futility&mdash;man is a &ldquo;useless passion,&rdquo; a &ldquo;failed
God,&rdquo; a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; in the heart of being.  For Sartre,
this amounts to the claim that the idea of God is
self-contradictory.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>  Of course, not all
philosophers who recognize the distinctive norm of authenticity hold
moral values to be groundless. A religious existentialist such as
Marcel explicitly denies Sartre's claim that we choose our values;
rather &ldquo;causes have their instrinsic value and, consequently,
values are real&hellip;I recognize them and then posit my actions in
accordance or in contradiction with these values&rdquo; (Marcel
1968:87). But Marcel's position is not typical, even for religious
existentialists.  Another frequently disputed question is whether,
given that moral values have no ultimate foundation, a definite
morality can nevertheless be derived from the norm of authenticity
itself. See Cooper (1999:178-84) for an attempt to show that the
Sartrean ideal of &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; and
Marcel's&mdash;apparently contrary&mdash;ideal of
&ldquo;openness&rdquo; are in fact complementary aspects of
authenticity.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>  As we saw (note 1
above) Alasdair MacIntyre argues that existentialism is just
disappointed rationalism and that its hyperbolic rhetoric stems from
its failure to abandon various foundationalist assumptions. It is true
that existentialism is a form of anti-foundationalism, and the
widespread rejection of foundationalist assumptions in contemporary
philosophy does remove some of the shock value of existentialist
theses. However, it does not do away with the shock value of anxiety
itself, and the carefree anti-foundationalist &ldquo;ironist&rdquo;
must admit, so long as anxiety remains a possibility, that there is a
deeper meaning to foundationalism&mdash;or a greater sting in its
loss&mdash;than irony can easily deal with.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>  The technicalities of
Sartre's arguments for these points, which ultimately turn on the
question of how intentionality can be explained ontologically, cannot
concern us here, but see Sartre (1992: 3-30), Crowell (2012: 199-226)
and the entry on Sartre in this Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>  Heidegger's
understanding of the relation between values and freedom has many
similarities with Sartre's view, though the differences are not
without importance. For a good treatment of these two thinkers see
Fell (1979).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>  For these reasons
existentialist ethics is often called an ethics of the
&ldquo;situation.&rdquo; As Mary Warnock (1967:37) writes, Sartre's
existentialism suggests that &ldquo;instead of coming to situations
armed with lists or sets of principles, some one of which has got to
be put into practice, we must think of each situation afresh, and try
to see what, stock descriptions, duties and principles apart, ought to
be done for the best. If we are faced with a situation in which we
have to make a moral decision, on this view, we must really
decide <em>for ourselves</em> what to do, remembering that
we <em>could</em> decide anything, and not seeking to evade
responsibility by sheltering under the rules, the principles, of what
one <em>must</em> do in such a case.&rdquo; In this connection,
existentialism anticipates current interest in the problem
of <em>judgment</em>&mdash;in particular, interest in the Kantian
idea, found in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, of a
&ldquo;reflective judgment&rdquo; that <em>seeks</em> the universal
for a given particular rather than merely subsuming a particular under
an already given universal or principle.</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> On why this narrative
structure of action does not entail that the self as such has a
narrative structure, see Crowell (2004).</p>

<p>

<a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>  It is a complicated
matter to say what the limits of such a &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; are.
See Guignon (1993) and Crowell (2004) for contrasting views.</p>
