<h2>From the Hellenistic to the Early Modern Era</h2>

<p>

Despite the obscurities surrounding the concept of 
<em>phantasia</em>, the impact on latter thinkers of Aristotle's 
account of cognition in general, and of imagery and imagination in 
particular, was enormous, and extended far beyond those who were 
avowed Aristotelians. Indeed, <em>phantasia</em> was an important 
concept in the epistemology and cognitive theory of the Stoic and 
Epicurean philosophical schools that dominated philosophy in the 
Hellenistic and earlier Roman Empire periods. However, the Stoics gave the 
word a rather different sense to that of Aristotle, and it is disputed 
whether his work had any significant impact on them (Sandbach, 1985; 
Long, 1986; Annas, 1992).</p>

<p>

The Epicurean understanding of imagery (and of cognition in general),
which we know mainly through the Latin verses of the Epicurean poet
Lucretius (c.99-50 B.C.E.), was certainly very different from that of
Aristotle. The Epicureans were atomists, committed materialists who
held that nothing exists but atoms &#8211; tiny, indivisible particles
in constant motion &#8211; and void. Our bodies, and all the objects
of our ordinary experience, consist of large clumps of atoms, but
because of their continual motion the atoms at the surfaces of things
are constantly being thrown off in the form of thin films of atoms
known as <em>eidola</em> or <em>simulacra</em>.  It is because of
these, it is held, that we are able to see. As they fly rapidly away
from their source, the simulacra initially retain the form of the
surface of the object from which they have come, and, if they enter
our eyes fairly soon after being emitted, they cause our visual
experience of the object (Lucretius,
<em>De Rerum Natura</em>, Bk. IV lns. 54-238; Epicurus, <em>Letter to Herodotus</em>).
</p>

<p>

However, we are told that by no means all such simulacra 
enter someone's eyes soon after they
are emitted. There are innumerably many of them, and many may fly around unperceived
for a long time. During that time, they may collide with one another and become
damaged and intermingled in various ways (simulacra may also form spontaneously
in the air, out of stray atoms coming together). Also, as atoms continue to fly
off in random directions, over time simulacra decay and become more and more
attenuated until eventually they are so fine that they can enter our bodies through
pores rather than through the eyes, and can enter even when our eyes are shut
in sleep. Thus, thanks to the attenuated and often fragmented and entangled simulacra
with which we are perpetually being bombarded, we have dreams and fantasies in
which we may experience visions of centaurs or other chimeric monsters, or of
men long dead (their simulacra may continue to be flying about, even long after
they themselves are gone), or, indeed, of any other things or combinations of
things that have ever existed. Like perceptions themselves, our imaginal experiences
were held, by the Epicureans, to come not from within us, but from outside. This
view seems to have extended even to deliberate thought. If we wish to mentally
represent something to ourselves, to think about it, we do so not by internally
constructing a representation, or by calling it up from some inner storehouse,
but by selecting (via some sort of active attention) appropriate images from
the enormous and diverse welter of attenuated, entangled, and fragmentary simulacra
that is incessantly bombarding us from without (Lucretius, <em>De Rerum Natura</em>, Bk.
IV lns. 722-822; see also: Long, 1986; Annas, 1992).
</p>

<p>

The revival of Platonism, that stemmed from the work of Plotinus in
the third century C.E., also led to a revival of Aristotelian
cognitive theory. What is now known as Neoplatonism rose to become the
dominant philosophical system of later antiquity, deeply influencing
late Roman and early medieval Christian thought (before being
displaced by overt Aristotelianism). Although, of course, the
Neoplatonists looked principally to Plato, in fact they also drew
liberally on Aristotle's work. Aware, as they were, of the twenty
formative years that Aristotle had spent studying under Plato in the
Academy, they regarded him not so much as a critic of his master (as
modern and Renaissance scholars tend to see him) but as an insightful,
if occasionally misguided, developer of themes within the Platonist
framework (Harris, 1976; Gerson, 2005; Karamanolis, 2006). As Plato
himself has relatively little to say about cognitive processes, and
Aristotle has much, this meant that Neoplatonist cognitive theory, and
particularly its view of imagery and imagination, was very largely
drawn from Aristotle (Wallis, 1972; Blumenthal, 1976, 1977-8, 1996;
Emilsson, 1988; Sheppard, 1991). It is true that Plotinus, the founder
of Neoplatonism, inveighs against the idea that either perception or
memory depend upon anything like imprints or impressions (i.e.,
something analogous to an impression in wax) in the soul
(<em>Ennead</em> IV, 6), but this is most plausibly read not as a
denial of the role of imagery experiences in memory and thought, but
rather of the theory that such experiences arise from the inner
presence of spatially extended, picture-like representations
(Emilsson, 1988) (something to which Aristotle himself may have been
less than committed (Nussbaum, 1978)). Like contemporary enactive
theorists of perception and imagery (see
 <a href="index.html#BeyPicPro">section 4.5</a>
 below), Plotinus does not regard either perceiving or imagining to be
forms of passive receptivity, but, rather, as involving an active 
reaching toward the object of the experience.</p>

<p>

As is well known, in the wake of the renaissance of learning of the 
12th century C.E. (Haskins, 1927), Aristotelianism soon became the 
dominant philosophy of Western Christendom, and continued as such 
until the dawn of the modern era. (Even before that, it had had a 
seminal influence on the Islamic philosophical tradition.) However, 
even as the revolt against Aristotelianism (presaging the rise of 
modern science) got under way in the 16th and 17th centuries, 
Aristotle's views about imagery (and certain other aspects of 
cognition) retained much of their influence.</p>

<p>

Consider, for example, 
Italian Renaissance philosopher Gianfrancesco Pico della 
 Mirandola,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupAriInf1" name="note-SupAriInf1">1</a>]</sup>
 who, in around 1500, published a work entitled <em>De 
Imaginatione</em> (<em>On the Imagination</em>) (Caplan, 1930) which 
relied heavily and overtly on Aristotle's discussions of 
<em>phantasia</em> and <em>phantasmata</em> (Caplan, 1930; Schmitt, 
1967). The book seems to have been quite widely read in the 16th 
century: at any rate, it went through five or six Latin editions as 
well as two editions in French translation (Schmitt, 1967 p. 57n6 
&amp; p. 191). Later in his career Pico became an outspoken and wide 
ranging critic of Aristotle's philosophy, a pioneer of the 
anti-Aristotelian movement. However, he explicitly did <em>not</em> 
repudiate his earlier work on imagination, remarking that although he
rejects Aristotle's teachings when they are false (most of the time, 
as he now thinks), he still accepts them when they are true (Schmitt,
1967 p. 57).</p>

<p>

Later, better-known, anti-Aristotelian philosophers of the early
modern period continue to show clear traces of Aristotelian influence
in their discussions of imagery and imagination. Rees (1971 p.194) and
White (1990), both remark how much Hobbes' account of imagination and
imagery (in <em>Leviathan</em> and <em>De Corpore</em>, particularly
&ndash;
 <a href="index.html#Hob">see section 2.3.2</a>)
 seems to rely upon Aristotle. This extends to very close parallels
between Hobbes' actual words and relevant passages in Aristotle's
<em>Rhetoric</em> (which Hobbes happened to have translated into
English). It is also notable how Descartes, in his <em>Treatise of
Man</em> (1664) describes the surface of the pineal gland as both the
seat of <em>imagination</em> (i.e., the image forming capacity), and
of <em>common sense</em> (the latter expression, as used here,
referring to a distinctively Aristotelian perceptual faculty that is
closely associated, or even identified, with imagination
(<em>phantasia</em>) in Aristotelian cognitive theory &ndash;
 <a href="index.html#Des">see section 2.3.1</a>, especially
 <a href="notes.html#9">note 9</a>).</p>
