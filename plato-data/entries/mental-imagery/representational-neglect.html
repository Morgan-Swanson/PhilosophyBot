<h2>Representational Neglect</h2>

<p>

The clinical neurological syndrome of <em>representational</em> (or 
<em>imaginal</em>) <em>neglect</em>, discovered in the late 1970s, is
probably best understood in connection with the closely associated 
perceptual deficit known as <em>left unilateral neglect</em> (or 
<em>hemineglect</em>), descriptions of which can be found in the
clinical literature as far back as 1876, and which has been quite
extensively studied since the early 20th century (Halligan &amp;
Marshall, 1993; Bartolomeo, 2007). Although not everyone who suffers
from perceptual unilateral neglect also has representational neglect,
representational without perceptual neglect seems to be relatively
rare (Coslett, 1997; Bartolomeo <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Bartolomeo,
2002, 2007).</p>

<p>

Left unilateral neglect is a fairly common consequence of damage to 
the parietal cortex of the <em>right</em> hemisphere of someone's 
brain (although other parts of the hemisphere, notably the superior 
temporal cortex, may also be implicated). (Similar damage to the left
hemisphere does <em>not</em> normally produce equivalent symptoms of 
right unilateral neglect, or, if it does, the symptoms are generally 
much milder, and recovery is relatively rapid (Driver &amp; 
Vuilleumier, 2003).) The syndrome manifests itself as a failure to 
notice or pay normal attention to things and events to the victim's 
left, and to the left sides of objects. Sufferers, who are generally 
unaware of their problem, have been known to do such things as 
forgetting to shave (or apply makeup to) the left side of their face,
forgetting to wear their left shoe, or failing to eat food on the 
left side of their plate despite complaining that they are still 
hungry. If asked to mark the midpoint of a horizontal line, they are 
likely to mark a point well to the right of center, and if asked to 
copy a drawing they will generally copy only the right-hand side, 
including few if any details to the left (see figure 1). Other sense 
modes as well as vision are also affected. Patients often fail to 
explore the left sides of objects when examining them by touch, and 
in acute cases may hold their head turned towards the right, and may 
fail to respond to questions from someone standing to their left, 
although they respond quite normally to someone on the right. Despite
all this, victims of unilateral neglect are clearly not blind or 
otherwise insensible to things on their left side. They can see 
things there if their attention is explicitly drawn to them, and may 
even occasionally spontaneously notice things to their left, 
especially if nothing much is going on to the right (Halligan &amp; 
Marshall, 1993; Bartolomeo &amp; Chokron, 2001; Driver &amp; 
Vuilleumier, 2003).</p>

the copies made of them by neglect patients.</p>

<p>

The fact that some patients suffering from unilateral neglect also
experience left <em>representational neglect</em>, affecting their
imagery and their memory performance, was first reported by Bisiach
&amp; Luzzatti (1978), who asked two neglect patients to imagine being
in the <em>Piazza Del Duomo</em>, a well known square in Milan, the
patients' native city, and to describe the buildings and other
features around the square. (One of the patients was also questioned
about the items in &ldquo;the studio where he had spent most of his
life,&rdquo; with very similar results.) When asked to imagine that
they were standing on the steps of the cathedral that is at one end of
the Piazza, nearly all of the features mentioned, by both subjects,
were ones that would have been to their right from that viewpoint, and
very few things on the left were recalled. When asked to imagine
standing at the opposite end of the square, facing the cathedral, most
of the features they mentioned were ones on the other, previously
neglected, side, which was now to their right.  Presumably, the
patients were forming a mental image of the Piazza, as viewed from the
specified location, and attempting to read off the features around it
from their imagery. Clearly knowledge of features on both sides
(presumably mostly gained before they became ill) was in their memory,
but they were unable to access all of it normally from their
imagery. Representational neglect has since been studied in numerous
other patients using other locations and various other stimuli,
ranging from irregular cloud-like shapes to maps of France (e.g.,
Bisiach, Luzzatti &amp; Perani, 1979; Bisiach <em>et al.</em>, 1981;
Ogden, 1985; Meador <em>et al.</em>, 1987; Sunderland, 1990;
Bartolomeo <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Rode <em>et al.</em>, 1998,
2004).</p>

<p>

Kosslyn (1994) claims that the phenomenon of representational neglect
lends support to quasi-pictorial theory, because it adds to the
already extensive roster of evidence suggesting that visual perception
and imagery make use of the same brain structures. Furthermore, as as
Bisiach &amp; Berti (1990) point out, and as Pylyshyn himself
concedes, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to think why a symbolic [i.e.,
mentalese] representation would favor one side of a scene over
another&rdquo; (Pylyshyn, 2003b &sect;7.4.3 ). On the other hand,
however, both Bartolomeo (2002; Bartolomeo &amp; Chokron, 2002) and
Pylyshyn (2002b &sect;R5.3, 2003b &sect;7.4.3) argue that it is
difficult to reconcile the facts of representational neglect with the
commitments of quasi-pictorialism.</p>

<p>

Kosslyn (1994) does not attempt to spell out an account of the
phenomenon, but two ways suggest themselves in which one might try to
fit it into his theoretical framework. One is the possibility that
part of the visual buffer of the neglect patient has been damaged, so
that the left sides of mental images (and percepts) are missing or
degraded in some way. However, this seems unlikely, especially as the
brain lesions that cause neglect are <em>not</em> in the
retinotopically mapped areas where the visual buffer is supposed to
be, and neglect affects all sense modes, and not just vision. It also
makes it difficult to explain why not <em>all</em> patients suffering
from one type of neglect (perceptual or representational) also suffer
from the other (Coslett, 1997; Bartolomeo, 2002; Bartolomeo &amp;
Chokron, 2002).</p>

<p>

Perhaps a more plausible suggestion is that the patients with
representational neglect are failing to pay attention to the left
sides of their inner quasi-pictures, much as they fail to pay
attention to the left side of their external environment
(Meador <em>et al.</em>, 1987; but see Della Sala <em>et al.</em>,
2004). However, this raises difficulties too. <em>Perceptual</em>
unilateral neglect clearly involves significant abnormalities
of <em>external</em> attentional mechanisms, such as the control of
gaze direction (both through the way the eyes and the head itself are
turned). This is not to say that internal attentional mechanisms are
not involved as well, they surely are, but it is notable that
when <em>external</em> attention is manipulated, inducing the patients
to turn their eyes more to the left (through techniques such as prism
adaptation, or by simply telling them to turn their head and eyes
leftwards) the symptoms not only of perceptual, but also of
representational neglect can be ameliorated (Meador <em>et al.</em>,
1987; Rode <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Rode, Rossetti &amp; Boisson, 2001;
but see also Rode <em>et al.</em>, 2007). This suggests that the
mechanisms of directional attention in general, in its external as
well as its internal aspect, are involved the representational neglect
phenomenon.</p>

<p>

In light of this, and other neurological evidence, Bartolomeo (2002;
Bartolomeo &amp; Chokron, 2002; Bartolomeo <em>et al.</em>, 2013; see
also Rode <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Bartolomeo <em>et al.</em>, 2005;
Dulin <em>et al.</em>, 2008) argues that enactive theory, that
explains imagery in terms of the operation of attentional mechanisms
that are normally directed at the outside world, provides a better
framework for the explanation of representational neglect. Pylyshyn
(2002b &sect;R5.3, 2003b &sect;7.4.3), despite his overarching
commitment to description theory, concedes a great deal to
Bartolomeo's position. More recently, Sima (2014 &sect;6.4) has argued
that his computer simulation model of the enactive theory of imagery
is well adapted to the incorporation of a principled, neurologically
realistic simulation of representational neglect, something that
Bartolomeo (2002) doubts is possible for models based upon pictorial
or description theories.</p>
