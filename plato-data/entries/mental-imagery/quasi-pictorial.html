<h2>The Quasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery, and its Problems</h2>

<p>

The basic functional architecture of Kosslyn's theory is shown in 
figure 1. This depicts what might be happening when someone considers
the question of whether a fox has pointed ears: by first constructing
a mental image of a fox, and then examining the ears in the image. 
(This, for Kosslyn, is prototypical of the sorts of task for which 
imagery is normally used in cognition).</p>

 <p style="text-align:center;">
 <strong>Figure 1</strong> <br /> The quasi-pictorial theory of 
imagery. [Based on Kosslyn (1980 p. 6)]. <br /> A 
&ldquo;quasi-picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;surface representation&rdquo; 
is constructed in the visual buffer on the basis of a description in 
LTM (Long Term Memory), and the &ldquo;mind's eye&rdquo; analyses it 
to extract the required information.</p>
 </td>

</table>

<p>

As the diagram shows, the data from which images may be constructed 
are taken to be stored in Long Term Memory in the form of <em>deep 
representations</em>, &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; descriptions of the
visual scene, presumably not dissimilar to the sorts of description 
envisaged by 
 Pylyshyn.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma1" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma1">1</a>]</sup>
 However, as Kosslyn sees it, these are not directly available to 
consciousness. They are analogous to the files in which data is saved
by a computer graphics program, and on the basis of which actual, 
viewable pictures are constructed on the screen of the computer 
monitor. When we form a mental image a <em>quasi-picture</em> or 
<em>surface representation</em> is constructed, on the basis this 
stored information, on a functionally defined surface that Kosslyn 
calls the <em>visual buffer</em>. This buffer is also supposed to be 
a stage in <em>perceptual</em> visual information processing (similar
in function to the 2&frac12;D sketch of Marr's (1982) theory of 
 vision<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma2" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma2">2</a>]</sup>),
 when it would receive its input from the eyes instead of from the 
Long Term Memory store. Once the quasi-picture is established on the 
buffer it is available to consciousness as an image, and, 
furthermore, information that was merely implicit in the deep 
representation (such as the pointedness of the fox's ears, in the 
depicted example) can be extracted from it by a postulated <em>mind's
eye function</em>. No doubt we are not supposed to think of this 
<em>mind's eye</em> as literally seeing the image, but it is needed 
to read and interpret the buffer's <em>surface display</em>. A 
principal function of images in cognition, as Kosslyn sees it, is to 
enable ready access to visuo-spatial features and relations of this 
sort, features or relations that might otherwise be very hard to 
infer from the &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; (mentalese) description.</p>

<p>

Kosslyn &amp; Shwartz (1977, 1978) developed a computer simulation 
model of key parts of Kosslyn's theory (<em>not</em> including the 
<em>mind's eye function</em>), and its instantiation of the 
<em>surface representation</em>, the model for the mental image
itself, is revealing. Figure 2 was produced by selectively filling
cells in a rectangular array or matrix, which models the visual buffer
of the underlying theory. Note that certain cells contain different
letters. Kosslyn plausibly assumes that images fade over time, and
successive letters of the alphabet represent older, successively more
faded portions of the image. The cells, then, are not simply filled or
unfilled, they contain symbols representing qualitative features of
the image at that point. It is what Tye (1991) calls a &ldquo;symbol
filled array&rdquo;. The theory assumes that each cell might contain
multiple symbols, representing such things as color, 3-D depth and the
presence of edges (Tye, 1991; Kosslyn, 1994) (although none of this,
beyond the degree of &#8220;fading&#8221;, was implemented in the
simulation).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
 <strong>Figure 2 <br /> </strong>Simulated image (<em>surface 
representation</em>) of a car, as generated by the Kosslyn &amp; 
Shwartz (1977) program.</p>

<p>

The array representation is constructed from a &#8220;deep
representation&#8221; description, stored in the computer's equivalent
of long term memory (as in figure 1 &#8211; the program had just two
&#8220;images&#8221; hand-coded in: a car, as shown in figure 2, and a
chair, in similar vein), and can thus be readily manipulated in
various ways. It can be redrawn at various different sizes, positions
and orientations on the buffer, and with varying amounts of detail
included. This allows Kosslyn to account for the rotation, scanning,
and size/inspection time effects which particularly interest him (see
section 4.3). He can also consistently explain the mnemonic properties
of imagery via a version of
 <a href="theories-memory.html">Dual Coding theory</a>
 (Kosslyn, Holyoak, &amp; Huffman, 1976).</p>

<p>

It is important to remember, however, that the <em>surface 
representation</em> is a <em>quasi</em>-picture or 
<em>functional</em> picture, rather than a picture in the fully 
literal sense (see Tye, 1991). The real model for the mental image is
not what is displayed on the computer screen, or printed out by the 
program. These representations, after all, are not available for 
further processing (such as by some <em>mind's eye function</em>) 
within the computer. They are just there for the benefit of human 
spectators. The real model for the mental image is the underlying 
array representation in the computer's memory, physically 
instantiated as electronic states in RAM chips. Image manipulations 
are carried out on this array, and merely mirrored on the screen or 
printout. But the array representation in the computer (and, its 
counterpart, if it exists, in the brain) is not in itself visible, 
like a real picture would be. Indeed, the representations of cells 
that appear adjacent in the screen display or printout need not even 
be in physically adjacent sections of RAM (though they might be). All
that matters is that they be treated as if they were adjacent by the 
computational routines which form, transform and inspect the array 
(Kosslyn, 
 1980).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma3" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma3">3</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>

Moreover, if, as suggested, each cell in the array holds several
symbols, for various represented qualities, there is no need for even
the symbols within a single cell to be represented in physically close
memory elements. We might have multiple arrays, one for each sort of
quality, so long as the accessing routines treat them as a single,
superposed, array with multiple symbols in each cell. This is
relevant, because in Kosslyn's more recent, neuropsychological version
of the theory the visual buffer is taken to be composed of multiple
arrays, instantiated in the multiple, specialized, retinotopically
mapped areas of visual cortex (the primary visual cortex, V1, and
other, adjacent visual areas) that are to be found in the brain's
occipital cortex, at the back of the head (Kosslyn, 1994, 2005;
Kosslyn, Ganis, &amp; Thompson, 2001; Kosslyn, Thompson, &amp; Ganis,
2006).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma4" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma4">4</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>

An interesting variant of the two-dimensional array model of Kosslyn 
&amp; Shwartz is proposed by Pinker (1988), who argues that a 
three-dimensional array will better incorporate the evidence that 
suggests that the spatial properties of imagery extend to the third 
dimension (Shepard &amp; Metzler, 1971; Pinker &amp; Kosslyn, 1978; 
Pinker, 1980; Pinker &amp; Finke, 1980; Kerr, 1987). (Perhaps this 
might be called a <em>quasi-sculptural</em> theory.) However, this 
idea seems to have attracted little attention, perhaps because it 
appears to be inconsistent with Kosslyn's ideas about the neural 
retinotopic maps, which are necessarily two-dimensional.</p>

<p>

The implementational details of the Kosslyn &amp; Shwartz computer
model, such as the fact that the points on the image are plotted with
polar co-ordinates, do not matter very much. Nor, indeed, does the
crudity of the images produced (as seen in figure 2). The point of the
model is simply to provide a concrete illustration of the theory, and
to show that, since it <em>can</em> be implemented, this part of the
theory does not contain an <em>undischarged homunculus</em> (Dennett,
1978 ch. 7), that would render it non-explanatory. (Of course, the
model does not show that there is no undischarged homunculus in
unimplemented parts of the theory, such as <em>the mind's eye
function</em>, which is where we would most likely expect him to be
lurking.) Several different ways of computationally implementing
(symbol filled) array theories of imagery have been proposed by AI
researchers since the original Kosslyn &amp; Shwartz work: some
connectionist (e.g. Julstrom &amp; Baron, 1985; Mel, 1986, 1990;
Stucki &amp; Pollack, 1992), and some not (e.g. Glasgow &amp;
Papadias, 1992; Glasgow, 1993). These all have interesting features,
but none attempt the psychological range of Kosslyn's model. We must,
of course, look to neuroscience for an account of how quasi-pictorial
imagery might actually be implemented, and that is what Kosslyn has
been doing over the last couple of decades (e.g., 1988, 1994, 2005;
Kosslyn, Thompson, &amp; Ganis, 2006).</p>

<p>

There has been much dispute between experimentalists over 
whether the brain imaging evidence (mostly fMRI and PET scans) 
supports the contention that V1, the primary visual cortex (which is by far
the largest retinotopically mapped area of the visual cortex, with, 
by some distance, the most detailed map) is preferentially activated during
visual imagery. Certainly many experiments have found that V1 activity
<em>is</em> elevated during imagery, but many others have found no
sign of this, and instead find elevated activity in other brain areas,
often ones that are not retinotopically mapped at all (see Kosslyn
&amp; Thompson, 2003, for review ).  Kosslyn &amp; Thompson (2003)
suggest that these apparently conflicting findings might be reconciled
if the activation level of V1 depends upon the sorts of task that the
experimental subjects are being asked to do with their imagery: Tasks
that do not require attention to the detailed geometric shape of
imagined objects, they suggest, may not activate V1, but may still
activate the other (low resolution) retinotopically mapped areas such
as those responsible for processing color, or visual motion, or
spatial layout information (see Mazard et al., 2004).</p>

<p>

There is, however, a further empirical difficulty in the way of the
identification of the retinotopically mapped areas with the <em>visual
buffer</em> of Kosslyn's theory. It appears that people can experience
vivid visual imagery even when at least some of the relevant parts of
the retinotopically mapped areas in their brain have been
damaged. There are many studies of people who are blind in all or part
of their visual field precisely because the corresponding part of V1
(or sometimes other, nearby retinotopically mapped areas) has been
destroyed, but who, nevertheless, seem either to have normal visual
imagery, or, in some cases, to experience well-formed
&#8220;hallucinations&#8221; (i.e., particularly vivid, spontaneous
imagery) specifically in those parts of the visual field where they
are thus blinded (Bridge <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Zago <em>et al.</em>,
2010; Dulin <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Ashwin &amp; Tsaloumas, 2007;
Kleiter <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Ramachandran &amp; Hirstein, 1997;
Roland &amp; Guly&agrave;s, 1994; Chatterjee &amp; Southwood, 1995;
Goldenberg <em>et al</em>., 1995; Gr&uuml;sser &amp; Landis, 1991
pp. 156-157; K&ouml;lmel, 1985; Lance, 1976; see also Servos &amp;
Goodale, 1995). This strongly implies that, even if imagery is
sometimes <em>accompanied</em> by activation of the V1 map (and/or
other occipital retinotopically mapped visual areas), it cannot be
dependent upon (let alone <em>identical with</em>) such
activation.</p>

<p>

But even if it were a fact that retinotopically mapped areas of the
brain are always active during visual imagery (which , as we have just
seen, it is not), is that strong evidence in favor the quasi-pictorial
theory? Clearly Kosslyn himself thinks so, but Pylyshyn still
demurs. The issue, he points out (Pylyshyn, 2002b, 2003b; see also:
Abell &amp; Currie, 1999; Thomas, 1999b; Dennett, 2002), is not
whether certain 2-D patterns of activation (corresponding to potential
patterns of retinal stimulation) exist in the brain, but whether such
patterns (<em>qua</em> patterns) play a causal role in generating the
behaviors that we see in experiments on imagery (and, we might add,
although Pylyshyn does not, in generating quasi-visual experiences).
Elevated activity in the retinotopic maps (if and when when it does
occur) might be no more than a side-effect of the brain processes that
are truly responsible for imagery.  Pylyshyn argues that, in fact, the
amount of information that can be represented at any one moment in the
retinotopic maps is not sufficient to support most of the experimental
imagery effects that quasi-pictorial theory purports to explain
(Pylyshyn, 2002b; cf. Ingle, 2002). Indeed, during visual perception
itself the information contained in the retinotopic maps at any one
moment is not sufficient to explain our experience of the visual
scene, or, indeed, our capacity to visually guide our behavior
(O'Regan, 1992; O'Regan &amp; No&euml;, 2001; No&euml;, 2004). Seeing
is not like taking a snapshot; it is a process that is extended in
time. It is true that it is possible to treat the primary visual
cortex as if it were a sort of photographic plate, with, at any one
moment, a
 (distorted<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma5" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma5">5</a>]</sup>
 and low resolution) snapshot
of the retinal image latent within it (Tootell <em>et al.</em>,
1982). However, we experience neither vision nor imagery as though
they were a succession of such snapshots.</p>

<p>

Quasi-pictorial theory also faces further empirical challenges. For 
one thing, all the major experimental effects that supposedly reveal 
the spatial and non-verbal properties of visual imagery (such as 
mental rotation, scanning, size/inspection time effects, and 
selective interference), have now been demonstrated in totally 
congenitally blind subjects (Marmor &amp; Zaback, 1976; Carpenter 
&amp; Eisenberg, 1978; Kerr, 1983; Hampson &amp; Duffy, 1984; Vecchi,
1998; Barolo <em>et al</em>., 1990; Aleman <em>et al.</em>, 
 2001).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupQuaPicTheIma6" name="note-SupQuaPicTheIma6">6</a>]</sup>
 As the stimuli in most of these experiments were presented haptically
(i.e., via the sense of touch), the blind subjects seem likely to be 
using haptic (touch based) imagery to do the experimental tasks (see 
Klatzky <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Prather &amp; Sathian, 2002). The 
trouble is that there seems little prospect of a haptic equivalent of
the quasi-pictorial theory of visual imagery (Thomas, 1999b). A 
&ldquo;passive-touch buffer&rdquo; (mapping the skin much as the 
visual buffer is supposed to map the retina) may be conceivable, but 
it would not be remotely adequate to the tasks in question. 
Haptically based knowledge of objects and spatial relations is 
clearly mediated not just by touch sensations, but by active, 
exploratory movements, involving a complex coordination between 
tactile sense, proprioception, and motor control (Davidson, 1972; 
Lederman &amp; Klatzky, 1990). Any theory of haptic mental imagery 
would surely need to incorporate this fact, and although it is 
conceivable that visual imagery might work in one (quasi-pictorial) 
way and haptic imagery in some quite different (presumably enactive) way, if that were so the formal 
similarity between the experimental results from the two populations 
(congenitally blind and sighted) would be a very strange coincidence.</p>

<p>

Another significant empirical challenge comes from the fact that 
experiments have shown that it is much more difficult for people to 
reinterpret or re-construe the structures or meanings of their mental
images than it is for them to reinterpret equivalent pictures. Images
seem to incorporate their interpretation in a way that pictures do 
not: As Wittgenstein remarked, &ldquo;the concept &lsquo;I am now 
seeing it as&nbsp;&hellip;.&rsquo; is akin to &lsquo;I am now having 
<em>this</em> image&rsquo;.&rdquo; (Wittgenstein, 1953 p. 213 &ndash;
ellipsis and emphasis in original). Several experiments have 
demonstrated this, but perhaps the most striking is that of Chambers 
&amp; Reisberg (1985; see also Chambers &amp; Reisberg, 1992) in 
which subjects attempted to reinterpret their mental images of 
bistable ambiguous figures (i.e., figures with two more or less 
equally plausible interpretations) such as the Necker cube and the 
duck-rabbit (figure 3).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

<br />
 <strong>Figure 3</strong>
 <br />
 The Necker cube and the duck-rabbit.</p>

<p>

Chambers &amp; Reisberg (1985) first introduced their subjects to the
concept of bistable ambiguous figures by showing them some examples, 
then showed them one of the figures that they had not previously 
seen, but only for 5 seconds, too short a time for them to see more 
than one of the possible interpretations. They were then asked to 
form a mental image of the figure they had just seen, and to try to 
find a second interpretation in their image. Despite having plenty of
time, and being given hints and encouragement by the experimenters, 
in no trial (out of 55 in all) did any of the subjects manage to see 
or even guess the alternative interpretation. Even more strikingly, 
when the subjects were then asked to draw the figures they had seen, 
on the basis of the image they had formed, in the vast majority of 
cases they were soon able to see the alternative interpretation in 
their own drawing.</p>

<p>

It should be admitted that in other experiments it has been shown that
the reinterpretation or reconstrual of images is possible under some
circumstances (Finke <em>et al</em>., 1989; Reisberg &amp; Chambers,
1991; Peterson <em>et al</em>., 1992; Brandimonte &amp; Gerbino, 1993;
Cornoldi <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Mast &amp; Kosslyn, 2002a;
Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Nevertheless, this does nothing to
undermine the integrity of the original results, and others that point
in the same direction (Reed, 1974; Palmer, 1977; Reisberg <em>et
al.</em>, 1989; Slezak, 1991, 1992, 1995). People clearly experience
significant difficulties in reconstruing their mental images under
conditions where they have very little trouble with the equivalent
picture. Images differ from pictures because they seem to carry their
interpretation within them in a way that pictures (even
quasi-pictures) do not.</p>

<p>

The quasi-pictorial theorist does have a comeback, however. For
largely independent reasons, Fodor (1975) suggested that if images
have a function in cognition, it must be as what he called <em>images
under descriptions</em>. To a first approximation, the idea is that
every mental picture comes tagged with a sort of mentalese caption,
telling us what it represents. Tye (1991), who explicitly supports a
quasi-pictorial account of imagery, takes a very similar view. Thus, a
subject in the Chambers &amp; Reisberg (1985) experiment who is
briefly shown the duck-rabbit figure might initially form a
quasi-picture of the figure tagged with the caption DUCK, and then be
unable to avoid interpreting it except in the light of this
description. (Presumably, if someone had the chance to view the figure
for more than a brief moment, as in most non-experimental situations,
they might have time to form <em>two</em> picture-description pairs,
and could thus later imagine it either way.)  Although this seems
rather <em>ad hoc</em> (why should we not be able to freely dissociate
and re-associate images and their descriptions?), Chambers &amp;
Reisberg (1992; Chambers, 1993; Reisberg, 1994) seem to be inclined to
interpret their results in broadly this fashion (see also Rollins,
1994).</p>

<p>

Fodor originally proposed that images always function in cognition 
<em>under a description</em> in order to account for the 
intentionality of mental pictures. Following Wittgenstein (1953 
&sect;139f; and see also Goodman, 1968), Fodor argued that pictures 
as such do not carry their interpretations within themselves (rather,
a person has to interpret them to see what they are pictures of), and
that, therefore, mental pictures as such cannot be intrinsically 
meaningful (bearers of <em>original intentionality</em>). Thus, Fodor
concluded, mental images cannot, in and of themselves, function as 
mental representations. However, he was impressed by the 
psychological evidence suggesting that images <em>do</em> function as
representations, and proposed that they should therefore be 
understood not as bare pictures, but as pictures under (mentalese) 
descriptions, inheriting their meaningfulness or intentionality from 
the mentalese caption. This move solves an important problem, and 
Kosslyn (although he has taken little interest in the matter of image
intentionality) seems to be prepared to countenance it (Kosslyn 1980 
p. 449ff, 1994 p.6). However, it also means that quasi-pictorial 
theory becomes beholden to the popular but controversial 
 <a href="../language-thought/">language of thought hypothesis</a>,
 and inherits all its problems and implausibilities (Hauser, 1995). 
Not the least of these is that, despite years of strenuous efforts to
reach one, there is no consensus as to how mentalese representations 
themselves could come to have original intentionality, and there is 
some reason to think that they could not (Horst, 1996, 1999; Cummins,
1997).</p>
