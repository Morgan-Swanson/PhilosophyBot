<h2>Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory</h2>

<p>

The Dual Coding Theory of memory was initially proposed by Paivio
(1971) in order to explain the powerful mnemonic effects of imagery
that he and others had uncovered, but its implications for cognitive
theory go far beyond these findings. It has inspired an enormous
amount of controversy and experimental research in psychology, and
played a very large role in stimulating the resurgence of scientific
and philosophical interest in imagery. Indeed, it has been described
as &ldquo;one of the most influential theories of cognition this
[20th] century&rdquo; (Marks, 1997), and has been fruitfully applied
to a wide range of psychological issues, including: thinking processes
(Paivio, 1975a); individual differences in thinking styles (Paivio
&amp; Harshman, 1983); language understanding (Paivio &amp; Begg,
1981); bilingualism (Paivio &amp; Desrochers, 1980; Paivio, 1986);
metaphor (Paivio, 1979); creative thinking (Paivio, 1983b); the
observational/theoretical distinction in science (Clark &amp; Paivio,
1989); the psychology of reading and writing (Sadoski &amp; Paivio,
2001); and even the use of visualization to enhance athletic
performance (Paivio, 1985; Hall <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Munroe <em>et
al.</em>, 2000).</p>

<p>

The more intricate details of Dual Coding Theory are beyond our scope
here, but the core idea is very simple and intuitive. Paivio proposes
that the human mind operates with two distinct classes of mental 
representation (or &ldquo;codes&rdquo;), verbal representations and 
mental images, and that human memory thus comprises two functionally 
independent (although interacting) systems or stores, verbal memory 
and image memory. Imagery potentiates recall of verbal material 
because when a word evokes an associated image (either spontaneously,
or through deliberate effort) two separate but linked memory traces 
are laid down, one in each of the memory stores. Obviously the 
chances that a memory will be retained and retrieved are much greater
if it is stored in two distinct functional locations rather than in 
just one.</p>

<p>

The laboratory evidence favoring the theory goes well beyond the 
original context of verbal learning experiments, however. For 
example, it is claimed that it finds experimental support in studies 
of memory for pictures (Richardson, 1980 ch.5) and in chronometric 
studies of mental comparisons of sizes, distances and other 
dimensions of variation (Paivio, 1975, 1978a, 1978b; Kosslyn, Murphy,
Bemesderfer, &amp; Feinstein, 1977; Moyer &amp; Dumais, 1978). 
Perhaps the most direct experimental support comes from work on the 
so called <em>selective interference</em> effect, which occurs when a
person tries simultaneously to do two mental tasks both of which call
for manipulation of representations from the same code (i.e., two 
verbal tasks, or two imagery/visuo-spatial tasks). In such 
circumstances, experimental subjects perform measurably more poorly 
(i.e., slower and/or with more errors) than they do when attempting 
either task together with one that calls upon the other code (i.e., a
verbal and a simultaneous imagery/visuo-spatial task) (Brooks, 1967, 
1968; Atwood, 1971; Segal &amp; Fusella, 1971; Baddeley <em>et 
al.,</em> 1975; Janssen, 1976a, 1976b; Baddeley &amp; Lieberman, 
1980; Eddy &amp; Glass, 1981; Hampson &amp; Duffy, 1984; Logie &amp; 
Baddeley, 1990; De Beni &amp; Mo&egrave;, 2003). Provided one 
interprets the imagery code primarily as a system for the 
representation of shape and spatial and spatio-temporal relationships
(rather than as specialized for encoding purely visual properties 
such as color or brightness) these results find a very natural 
interpretation in Dual Coding terms: two tasks that use the same code
interfere strongly with one another because they call upon the same 
representational and processing 
 resources.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupDuaCodComCodTheMem1" name="note-SupDuaCodComCodTheMem1">1</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>

Nevertheless, the proper interpretation of these experiments (and all
the other multifarious relevant laboratory findings) and thus the 
empirical status of Dual Coding Theory itself, remains controversial.
Throughout its history, the theory has been developed and interpreted
in the context of opposition to various forms of what have come to be
known as <em>common coding</em> theories of memory: Theories 
committed to explaining all the relevant phenomena in terms of just 
one type of code (representational format) <em>common</em> to all 
memories. Thus, to properly understand Dual Coding Theory and the 
controversies that have surrounded it, it is important to be aware 
that the prevailing conception of the nature of this <em>common 
code</em> have changed quite radically over the course of the 
<em>dual coding</em> versus <em>common coding</em> controversy.</p>

<p>

It is also important to distinguish the <em>dual/common coding</em> 
debate from the better known (at least to philosophers), and ongoing,
<em>analog</em> versus <em>propositional</em> debate about imagery, 
which arose a few years later, in the early 1970s (and will be 
covered in 
 <a href="index.html#AnaProDeb">section 4.4</a>).
 Although these two controversies did become very entangled, the main
points at issue are quite different, and an explicit awareness of this
may help us avoid some of the confusions that arose from the
entanglement. The <em>analog/propositional</em> debate concerns the
nature of imagery itself (to put it very crudely, the <em>analog</em>
side thinks mental images are inner pictures, and the
<em>propositional</em> side think they are inner descriptions),
whereas the <em>dual/common coding</em> debate concerns the functional
role played by imagery in the cognitive processes of memory and
thought. It may be true that that, amongst cognitive scientists, Dual
Coding Theory is most often associated with an <em>analog</em>
conception of imagery, and <em>common coding</em> is associated with
the <em>propositional</em> conception. However, given that Paivio conceives of his <em>verbal code</em> to be embodied as natural language, inner speech, there seems to be no
reason to think that it is incoherent to combine a
<em>propositional</em> view of imagery with a form of Dual Coding
Theory, as Baylor (1972) and Kieras (1978) have proposed. There also
appear to be no <em>prima facie</em> reasons to think that the
enactive theory of imagery (see
 <a href="index.html#EnaThePerIma" target="other">&sect;4.5.1 of the main entry</a>)
 might be
inconsistent with Dual Coding. Furthermore, although perhaps no
contemporary theorists combine an <em>analog</em> theory of imagery
with a <em>common coding</em> theory of memory, it is arguable that
this view was implicit in many of the cognitive theories of former
times.  For instance, Empiricist philosophers such as Berkeley and
Hume (and, very arguably, Aristotle) thought of images as being
picture-like (<em>analog</em>), and held that all memories (indeed,
all mental contents, all <em>ideas</em>) are images of some sort
(<em>common code</em>) (see
 <a href="index.html#ImaIdeModPhi" target="other">&sect;2.3 Images as Ideas in Modern Philosophy</a>).</p>

<p>

When Paivio initially developed Dual Coding Theory in the 1960s, 
however, psychological thinking was still dominated by 
neo-Behaviorism, and the prevailing view was that human memory (where
it goes beyond the operant or classical conditioning also seen in 
animals) depends entirely on words, on inner or subvocal speech in 
one's native tongue: the <em>common code</em> was taken to be a 
verbal code. This, however, was soon to change. In the very same era 
that Paivio's ideas were becoming influential, rapid developments in 
psycholinguistics, the influence of Artificial Intelligence research,
and the rise of the computational <em>information processing</em> 
approach to cognition were profoundly affecting psychological 
conceptions of mental representation. Although mainstream memory 
researchers still mostly focused on memory for verbal material, many 
came to think of this as encoded in the mind in an abstract format 
analogous to the &ldquo;deep structures&rdquo; of Chomskian 
linguistic theory or the nested data structures of programming 
languages such as LISP (Collins &amp; Quillian, 1969; Anderson &amp; 
Bower, 1973). Thus, by the mid 1970s a very different form of 
<em>common coding theory</em> had become prevalent. Computationally 
oriented psychologists began to think of memories as being stored as 
what they called &ldquo;propositional representations&rdquo;, or just
&ldquo;propositions&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

It is important to be aware that this use of the word 
&lsquo;proposition&rsquo; differs, subtly but significantly, from the
well established philosophical use of the term, whereby propositions 
are distinguished sharply from representations (mental or otherwise),
and are considered instead to be the underlying, entirely abstract 
meanings (truths or falsehoods) that representations (such as 
sentences) may express (Gale, 1967). Thus, following the very 
influential work of Fodor (1975), philosophers expounding 
computational theories of mind have usually preferred to talk about 
&ldquo;sentential&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; 
representations, with the understanding that the relevant sentences 
are to be thought of as expressed not in English (or any other 
natural, spoken, language) but in <em>mentalese</em>, a computational
&ldquo;language of thought&rdquo; that is (hypothetically) built into
the brain, somewhat as a computer's machine code is built into its 
CPU. But although it seems to capture their intentions quite well, 
this philosophical terminology is not widely used by psychologists. 
In what follows, the philosophical <em>mentalese</em> terminology 
will generally be favored, but readers should be aware that most of 
the psychological authors discussed in fact speak of 
<em>propositional</em> representations.</p>

<p>

It is very arguable that the &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; <em>common
coding</em> theory of memory is more elegant and parsimonious than
Dual Coding Theory; certainly it coheres more readily with the broadly
computational conception to the mind that remains dominant in
cognitive science.  Paivio argues, however, that parsimony in terms of
representational formats is bought at the cost of a need to posit more
types of cognitive processes. He also makes a strong case that Dual
Coding Theory has the advantage in its ability to account for the
broad range of empirical evidence. The theory has stood up well over
the decades both to vigorous conceptual criticism and to many
attempted experimental refutations, and Paivio has continued to
develop, elaborate, and defend it, periodically reviewing the relevant
experimental literature (Paivio, 1971, 1977, 1983a, 1986, 1991a, 1995,
2007; Paivio &amp; Begg, 1981; Sadoski &amp; Paivio, 2001 &ndash; for
less partisan reviews see Morris &amp; Hampson, 1983; Thomas, 1987;
Richardson, 1980, 1999).</p>
