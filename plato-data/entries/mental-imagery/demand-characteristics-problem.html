<h2>The Problem of <em>Demand Characteristics</em> in Imagery Experiments</h2>

<p>

In the field of human experimental psychology it is now widely 
recognized that an experimenter's hopes and expectations about the 
outcome of an experiment can have considerable (usually unintended) 
effects on the actual outcome, sometimes to the point of invalidating
the results (Rosenthal, 2002). One of the most important ways this 
can occur is through the effect of what are called <em>experimental 
demand characteristics</em> on the performance of the human subjects 
(Orne, 1962; Rosnow, 2002).</p>

<p>

In a seminal article, Orne (1962) defined the <em>demand 
characteristics of the experimental situation</em> as &ldquo;the 
totality of cues which convey an experimental hypothesis to the 
subject,&rdquo; and pointed out that such cues may include:</p>

<blockquote>the rumors or campus scuttlebutt about the research, the
information conveyed during the original solicitation, the person of
the experimenter, and the setting of the laboratory, as well as all
explicit and implicit communications during the experiment proper. A
frequently overlooked, but nonetheless very significant source of cues
for the subject lies in the experimental procedure itself, viewed in
the light of the subject's previous knowledge and experience. For
example, if a test is given twice with some intervening treatment, even
the dullest college student is aware that some change is expected,
particularly if the test is in some obvious way related to the
treatment. (Orne, 1962)</blockquote>

<p>

Orne argued (and the point is now generally accepted by experimental 
psychologists) that in most experimental situations involving human 
subjects, the subjects are strongly motivated to &ldquo;help&rdquo; 
the experimenter by providing the sorts of results that they think 
are expected or hoped for. Even though they will not normally be told
what the experimenter is hoping or expecting to find before they take
part, most experimental subjects will do their best to infer or guess
these expectations or hopes from the demand characteristics of the 
situation, and will often be fairly successful. (The problem is 
exacerbated if, as is so often the case, the subjects are psychology 
undergraduates, more than averagely motivated to please their 
professors and to further the goals of psychological science, and 
better placed than most to make a good guess as to what an experiment
might be about.) Unfortunately, these guesses (whether right or 
wrong) can become a significant determinant of a subject's actual 
performance in the experiment, and can overshadow the contribution of
the factors that the experiment was intended to investigate. If these
&ldquo;demand&rdquo; effects are not kept under control, experimental
results may reflect the subjects' desire to please much more than 
they provide any insight into the real mechanisms of cognition.</p>

<p>

The degree to which this is a serious problem depends in large part 
on the ways particular experiments are constructed. For example, in 
an experiment to see whether the use of an imagery mnemonic can 
improve memory recall, we can probably be confident that, whether or 
not the subject guesses what the experiment is about, any actual 
improvement in memory performance is indeed due to the mnemonic. 
After all, simply wanting to please the experimenter will not 
actually give someone a better memory.</p>

<p>

Other experiments, however, including many of the most interesting 
experiments on the spatial properties of imagery, depend at crucial 
junctures upon the subjective judgement of the subjects (as to 
whether they are doing the experimental task correctly, or have 
successfully completed it, for example). There is good evidence that 
experimental demand can have significant distorting effects on 
findings in experiments of this sort. Richman and his collaborators 
(Richman <em>et al.</em>, 1979 a,b; Mitchell &amp; Richman, 1980; 
Goldston <em>et al.</em>, 1985) have shown experimentally that the 
results of mental scanning experiments can be markedly affected by 
demand characteristics, Sheehan &amp; Neisser (1969) and DiVesta, 
Ingersoll, &amp; Sunshine (1971) have shown that self-ratings of 
imagery vividness are probably so affected, and Intons-Peterson 
(1983) has shown that quite a range of cognitive imagery processes 
are surprisingly susceptible even to unintentionally and very subtly 
conveyed experimenter expectations.</p>

<p>

Intons-Peterson (1983) tested the demand susceptibility of three 
different experimental imagery tasks: a task used by Finke &amp; 
Kurtzman (1981a, 1981b) in their work on &ldquo;measuring the visual 
angle of the mind's eye&rdquo;; an image scanning task based upon the
well-known experiment of Kosslyn, Ball &amp; Reiser (1978), in which 
subjects were asked to scan across a mental image of a map; and a 
mental rotation task based on an experiment by Cooper &amp; Shepard 
(1975). Intons-Peterson required her subjects to do two versions of 
each task, one which called for the use of mental imagery, and 
another where the relevant stimuli were actually perceptually 
present.</p>

<p>

However, she did not &ldquo;run&rdquo; the experimental subjects 
herself. Instead she used a number of &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; 
experimenters to instruct the subjects in their tasks, and to collect
the results. Half of these assistants were led to believe that their 
subjects would perform better (more quickly or more accurately) in 
the perceptual condition of the experiments, and the others were led 
to believe that their subjects would perform better in the imagery 
condition. (Plausible rationales were cooked up to make each type of 
expectation seem believable.) The assistant experimenters were warned
not to reveal these expectations to the subjects, and, indeed, they 
were not allowed to use their own words in instructing the subjects, 
but had to read the instructions from written scripts (which were the
same regardless of the experimenters induced expectations). Despite 
this, the subjects' performances, on all the tasks, turned out to be 
significantly affected by their experimenter's expectations. They 
performed better in the condition (imagery or perceptual) in which 
their experimenter expected them to perform better.</p>

<p>

When videotapes of the experimental sessions were carefully examined,
it eventually became apparent what was going on. The assistant 
experimenters were reading out the instructions for the condition 
where they expected better performance more slowly and clearly. This 
quite unintentional non-verbal cue turned out to be quite enough to 
affect the subjects' performances.</p>

<p>

Intons-Peterson's experiment does not necessarily invalidate the 
claims of Kosslyn, Shepard, and others about the inherently spatial, 
analog nature of visual imagery. After all, as Jolicoeur &amp; 
Kosslyn (1985) point out, the mental scanning effect demonstrated by 
Kosslyn, Ball &amp; Reiser (1978) (i.e., a linear relationship 
between the distance scanned over an image and the time taken) was 
still apparent in Intons-Peterson's findings, quite regardless of her
experimenters' expectations about image versus perceptual conditions.
(The same can be said for the mental rotation effect.) Furthermore, 
the image scanning and image rotation effects have been demonstrated 
in experiments where no explicit instructions to scan or rotate (or 
even to form a mental image) were given (Shepard &amp;
Metzler, 1971; Finke &amp; Pinker, 1982, 1983; Pinker, Choate, &amp; Finke, 1984; but see Borst <em>et al.</em>, 2006).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupProDemChaImaExp1" name="note-SupProDemChaImaExp1">1</a>]</sup>
 Nevertheless, Intons-Peterson's findings should give us considerable 
pause. It is clear that many imagery experiments may be significantly
affected even by subtle, unintentionally conveyed and unconsciously 
absorbed, demand characteristics. The literature of the cognitive 
psychology of imagery is full of arguments and counter-arguments over
whether one or another experimental result is meaningful, or can be 
dismissed as an effect of demand. Such criticisms deserve to be taken
seriously. They can only be evaluated by giving attention to the 
specifics of particular experimental designs.</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, and perhaps especially when one is interested in a 
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo; phenomenon like imagery, it can sometimes be
difficult or impossible to design an experiment that both addresses 
the question of interest and precludes the possibility that demand 
characteristics have affected the outcome. In such circumstances, one
possible recourse, that has been used quite frequently in imagery 
experimentation (particularly by Kosslyn), is to conduct a 
post-experimental interview with each of the subjects, and ask them 
what they think the experimental hypothesis and the variables of 
interest might have been. Data from subjects who guess anything like 
correctly can then be excluded from the final data analysis. However,
as Orne (1962) pointed out, although they probably help, techniques 
of this sort are far from fully satisfactory. If, as may often be the
case, a subject intuits the purpose of an experiment only in a vague,
inarticulate way, then, even though this might be sufficient to 
affect their experimental performance, they might not be able, or 
confident enough, to explain their guess to the experimenter. 
Furthermore, post-experimental interviews can themselves be affected 
by demand characteristics. Inasmuch as a subject realizes that the 
experimenter hopes that they have <em>not</em> understood the purpose
of the experiment, they may be inclined to downplay how much they 
have, in fact, guessed.</p>
