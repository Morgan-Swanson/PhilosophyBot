<h2>Other Quasi-Perceptual Phenomena</h2>

<p>

It is largely because of the features of intentionality and voluntary
control that imagery may be seen as a quintessentially 
<em>mental</em> phenomenon, in contrast to other sorts of 
quasi-perceptual phenomena, such as <em>afterimages</em> (Richardson,
1969 ch.2; Gr&uuml;sser &amp; Landis, 1991 ch. 23) and 
<em>phosphenes</em> (Oster, 1970; Gr&uuml;sser &amp; Landis, 1991
chs. 10 &amp; 23), both of which are generally thought to be
explicable in purely (and fairly straightforward) physiological
terms. Afterimages and phosphenes are phenomenologically quite
different from the mental imagery of memory and imagination, and they
seem <em>not</em> to bear intentionality (and so, unlike mental
images, they do not function as mental representations), and they
are <em>not</em> subject to direct voluntary control. Also, mental
imagery should not be (and rarely is) confused with the hypothetical
very short-term visual memory store known as <em>iconic memory</em>
(or <em>the icon</em>) (Sperling, 1960; Neisser, 1967; Long, 1980;
Haber, 1983). Although this, at least arguably, is cognitive and
representational rather than a purely physiological function, unlike
imagery it functions automatically and unconsciously, and is quite
outside our voluntary control.</p>

<p>

On the other hand, the rare, poorly understood, and controversial
phenomenon known as <em>eidetic imagery</em> apparently resembles
ordinary mental imagery in intentionality, but is said to be
phenomenologically distinct in point of its great vividness, detail,
and stability, and because it is &ldquo;externally projected,&rdquo;
experienced as &ldquo;out there&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in the
head&rdquo;. Thus the experience of eidetic imagery is supposedly much
more akin to seeing a real, external object or scene, than is ordinary
imagery experience. (However, <em>eidetikers</em>, as they are
sometimes called, are generally reported as having a fair degree of
voluntary control over their eidetic images, and rarely if ever seem
to mistake them for objective realities.) According to Haber (1979),
eidetic ability is found almost exclusively amongst young children,
and is fairly rare even amongst them, occurring only in about 2% to
15% of American under-twelves. Furthermore, the eidetic images are
said to persist only for a maximum of about four minutes after the
visual stimulus of which they are a memory has been removed from sight
(Haber &amp; Haber, 1964). Other investigators, however, claim to have
found evidence of eidetic ability in adults, particularly ones from
&#8220;primitive&#8221; cultures (Jaensch, 1930; Doob, 1964, 1965,
1966, 1972; Feldman, 
1968),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#OthQuaPer1" name="note-OthQuaPer1">1</a>]</sup>
 and Ahsen (1965, 1977) apparently
holds that most or all of us have at least the potential to recall
eidetic images virtually at will. (These differences of opinion may,
at least partly, arise from different assumptions about the meaning of
the ambiguous and contested term &#8220;eidetic&#8221;.) </p>

<p>

A rather well known case of an alleged adult eidetiker is a woman,
known by the pseudonym <em>Elizabeth</em>, studied by Stromeyer &amp;
Psotka (1970; Stromeyer, 1970). The abilities ascribed to her,
however, are not at all typical of those claimed by or for other eidetikers. The most
impressive of her unique and surprising alleged feats was that she was
supposedly able to use her eidetic ability to remember one half of a
million-dot random dot stereogram with unbelievable accuracy. Then,
when the second half of the stereogram was presented some hours later,
she is said to have been able to eidetically fuse the two halves, so
that she could "see" the three-dimensional shape thus produced
(normally such 3-D fusion only takes place when the two halves of the
stereogram are presented <em>simultaneously</em>, one to each of a
subject's
 eyes).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#OthQuaPer2" name="note-OthQuaPer2">2</a>]</sup>
 However, Blakemore <em>et al.</em>
(1970) raise concerns about the methodology of the study, and are
clearly skeptical of the claims made for <em>Elizabeth</em>, which,
they say, if true, would entail "radical changes in thinking on visual
processing." As there is no credible account of anyone else coming
anywhere close to duplicating this truly incredible performance in
subsequent research, it is probably unwise to give the case much
evidential weight. Despite considerable effort having been put into
the search, nobody with even remotely similar abilities has been found
(Merritt, 1979). Certainly the child eidetikers studied by Haber
(1979) and others do not begin to be capable of any such feat (indeed,
after, at most, about four minutes, by which time the eidetic image
has supposedly faded, they are no better at recalling visual details
of things than are non-eidetikers (Haber &amp; Haber, 1964)),
and <em>Elizabeth</em> herself has apparently refused to be
re-tested. (See Joshua Foer&#8217;s article &#8220;No One Has a
Photographic Memory: Kaavya Syndrome,&#8221;
in <a href="index.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>.)</p>

<p>

In fact, there is <em>no</em> scientific consensus regarding the
nature, the proper definition, or even the very existence of eidetic
imagery, even in children (see the commentaries published with Haber,
1979). Some investigators, most notably Haber (1979), hold that it is
a real (albeit elusive), distinct, and <em>sui generis</em>
psychological phenomenon, whose mechanisms and psychological functions
(if any) may well turn out to be quite different from those of
ordinary memory or imagination imagery.  Others, however, such as Gray
&amp; Gummerman (1975) and Bugelski (1979), argue that reports of
eidetic imagery are best understood merely as rather hyperbolic
descriptions that are sometimes given, by some children (and, perhaps,
the occasional uneducated and illiterate adult), of ordinary (though
perhaps particularly vivid) visual memory imagery.</p>

<p>

It may also be worth pointing out that mental imagery should not generally be 
confused with <em>imagery</em> as the term has come to be used in 
literary criticism, where it usually seems to mean something like 
<em>metaphor</em> or <em>figurative language</em>, and, in particular,
highly concrete, perceptually specific language that is used primarily
for its suggestive or emotional effect. Furbank (1970) has traced the
history of this usage (of which he is sharply critical). It seems
likely that the usage originally arose because it was assumed that the
distinctive effects of these linguistic tropes arise from their power
to arouse actual mental imagery in a reader, and some literary
theorists and educators have more recently attempted to revive
versions of this way of thinking about literary imagery, and to ground
the literary theory of imagination in the cognitive science of imagery
(Collins, 1991; Esrock, 1994; Scarry, 1995, 1999; Zitlow, 2000;
Ponzio, 2013; Troscianko, 2010, 2013, 2014a,b).  However, it is
certainly not safe to assume that someone who mentions imagery in a
literary context necessarily intends to allude to quasi-perceptual
experience.</p>
