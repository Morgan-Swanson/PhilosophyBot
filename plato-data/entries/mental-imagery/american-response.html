<h2>The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery</h2>

<p>

Where the Gestalt psychologists, for the most part, ignored the 
concept of imagery, the Behaviorist movement, which came to dominate 
American (and, eventually, international) scientific psychology for 
almost half a century, actively repudiated it. To borrow a coinage 
from Dennett (1978), Behaviorist psychology was thoroughly 
<em>iconophobic</em>. Although the rapid rise of Behaviorism in the 
United States in the early years of the 20th century certainly had 
multiple causes, social and institutional as well as intellectual 
(O'Donnell, 1985), the imageless thought controversy, and the 
questions it raised about introspection as a viable scientific 
methodology, was certainly prominent amongst the intellectual causes.
In the famous &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; by which John B. Watson 
publicly launched Behaviorism as a self-conscious movement, the 
controversy over imageless thoughts is cited as the prime
 example<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupAmeRes1" name="note-SupAmeRes1">1</a>]</sup> 
 of the malaise of 
psychological methodology for which Behaviorism would be the cure 
(Watson, 1913a). In a lengthy footnote to this manifesto, and in a 
follow-up article (Watson, 1913b), Watson cast doubt on the very existence of
mental imagery, a position he was to state more forcefully in later 
work, where he stigmatized the concept (together with all other 
remotely mentalistic concepts) as a thoroughly unscientific, 
&ldquo;medieval&rdquo; notion, inextricably bound up with religious 
belief in an immortal soul, and, as such, barely one step away from 
&ldquo;old wives tales&rdquo; and the superstitions of 
&ldquo;savagery&rdquo; (Watson, 1930). He described personal reports 
of such things as memory images of one's childhood home as 
&ldquo;sheer bunk,&rdquo; nothing more than the sentimental 
&ldquo;dramatizing&rdquo; of verbally mediated memories (i.e. 
conditioned tendencies to <em>say</em> certain things, either out 
loud or sub-vocally) (Watson, 1928).</p>

<p>

Not all American psychologists, even avowed Behaviorists, were quite 
as vehement as Watson in their denunciation of mentality in general, 
or imagery in particular, but his views certainly resonated with 
many. The publication of Watson's manifesto (1913a) had, in fact, 
been preceded by several less radical critiques of introspective 
methodology from other American psychologists (Danziger, 1980). 
Particularly relevant here is Knight Dunlap's &ldquo;The Case Against
Introspection&rdquo; (1912), because Dunlap, who was a junior 
colleague of Watson in the Johns Hopkins University Psychology 
Department, seems to have played a crucial if inadvertent role in the
formation of Watson's attitude towards imagery, and, thereby, in the 
crystallization of Behaviorism itself (Cohen, 1979; Thomas, 1989).</p>

<p>

During his early days at Johns Hopkins (where he arrived in 1908) 
Watson, by his own account, believed that &ldquo;centrally aroused 
visual sensations [i.e., mental images] were as clear as those 
peripherally aroused&rdquo; (Watson, 1913a), and when Dunlap told 
Watson of his skepticism concerning what he (Dunlap) called 
&ldquo;the old doctrine of images&rdquo; Watson initially demurred, 
insisting that he himself made important use of visual imagery, for 
example in the process of designing experimental apparatus (Dunlap, 
1932; cf. Watson, 1936).</p>

<p>

However, by this time Watson already seems to have been ambitious to 
approach human psychology using the methodology that he had already 
successfully developed for the study of animal behavior (Watson, 
1924, 1936). By 1910, the only real factor preventing Watson from 
conceiving of the study of behavior as embracing the whole of 
psychology seems to have been &ldquo;the problem of the higher 
thought processes&rdquo; (Burnham, 1968): Thought was supposed to be 
carried on primarily in imagery, and imagery was not behavior (see 
Watson, 1913b). Dunlap's objections to the &ldquo;old doctrine&rdquo;
that held visual imagery to consist in &ldquo;centrally aroused 
visual sensations&rdquo; seems to have played a crucial role in 
emboldening Watson to deny the existence of imagery altogether, thus 
enabling him to present the study of behavior as a fully sufficient 
methodology for psychology (Watson, 1924). Perhaps he believed that 
his theoretical commitment to the nonexistence of mental pictures 
<em>entailed</em> a commitment to the nonexistence of quasi-visual 
experiences (Thomas, 1989; see also Berman &amp; Lyons,
 2007).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupAmeRes2" name="note-SupAmeRes2">2</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

However, Dunlap never became a Behaviorist himself (Dunlap, 1932), 
and when his actual views about imagery are examined (Dunlap, 1914) 
it becomes apparent that he did not intend to deny that people have 
experiences that are, in a significant sense, quasi-perceptual. 
Although he described himself as an &ldquo;iconoclast&rdquo; (1932), 
and held that &ldquo;the image, as a copy or reproduction of 
sensation . . . does not exist,&rdquo; (Dunlap,1914), Dunlap also 
asserted that Watson went much too far in rejecting 
&ldquo;imagination&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;images&rdquo; (Dunlap, 
1932), and he continued to hold that we are in need of an account of 
the nature of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;. Something, something mental and, 
indeed, quasi-perceptual, is needed to fill the functional role that 
images played in the traditional psychology of thinking. It is clear 
that he (unlike Watson) did not deny the existence of imagery in the 
sense in which it was defined at the beginning of this article (i.e. 
quasi-perceptual experience). Dunlap's theory would seem to be best 
understood as a pioneering (though perhaps, ultimately, unconvincing)
attempt to explain both the experience of imagery, and the functional
role that it plays in thinking, in a way that avoids postulating the 
presence of pictures in the head, or inner copies of former sense 
impressions.</p>

<p>

According to Dunlap, <em>ideas</em> are actually complexes of 
muscular sensations, caused by outwardly imperceptible movements, or,
at least, tensings, of the muscles, particularly (though not 
exclusively) the muscles associated with the sense organs themselves,
such as those that move the eyes. Particular patterns of muscular 
response, Dunlap holds, occur during the perception of particular 
types of objects or events, and may be aroused not only in the course
of the actual perception of a relevant object, but also through 
associative links with the sensations produced by other muscular 
response patterns appropriate to other sorts of objects or events. 
These latter patterns may have arisen in actual perception, or may 
themselves have been aroused associatively in a similar way. Thus, 
associative trains of thought can be sustained. When the muscular 
response is aroused associatively, rather than by the actual 
perceptual presence of the relevant object, we experience the idea, 
or image, of the object. Visual imagery consists not of copies or 
echoes of visual sensations, but rather of actual current sensations 
in the muscles involved in the process of seeing something.</p>

<blockquote>There is indeed a present content essentially connected
with imagination or thought; but this present content is in each case a
muscle sensation, or a complex of muscle sensations. We are therefore,
in investigating images, dealing not with copies, or pale ghosts, of
former sensations but with actual present sensations. (Dunlap,
1914)</blockquote>

<p>

These muscle sensations are, explicitly, not to be confused with the 
impalpable <em>imageless thoughts</em> of W&uuml;rzburg, rather, 
&ldquo;This sensation is the true <em>image</em>&rdquo; (Dunlap, 
1914, emphasis in original). (For a more extensive account of 
Dunlap's theory of imagery, and its influence on Watson, see Thomas 
(1989).)</p>

<p>

Dunlap's theory of imagery/ideas was publicly presented only in one
brief and rather obscurely published article (Dunlap, 1914) and (apart
from its unintended and covert influence on Watson), it seems to have
attracted very little interest from his contemporaries. The theory
probably owes much to the influence of Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg, whose
&ldquo;motor theory&rdquo; of the mind had a considerable vogue
amongst American psychologists at the time. Although it was quickly
eclipsed, as a movement, by the rise of Behaviorism, it has had a
continuing influence on psychological and cognitive theory (Scheerer,
1984; Weimer, 1977). M&uuml;nsterberg was a German, a former student
of Wundt, who had been hired to teach psychology at Harvard when
William James moved on, and Dunlap had studied under him before coming
to Johns Hopkins (Dunlap, 1932). Another non-pictorialist theory of
imagery (relating the phenomenon to attentional processes) had been
sketched a little earlier by the pioneering French psychologist
Theodule Ribot (1890, 1900), and related ideas also surface later in
the Soviet tradition of psychology (Wekker, 1966), in the neuroscience
(and neurophilosophy) of Sperry (1952), and in the
&ldquo;enactive&rdquo; imagery theories of more recent times (see
section 4.5). However, the most fully developed version of the motor
theory of imagery was surely that of Margaret Floy Washburn, a former
student of Titchener. Washburn (unlike Dunlap) is quite open in
acknowledging her intellectual debt to M&uuml;nsterberg (Washburn,
1932), and in her <em>Movement and Mental Imagery</em> (1916) she goes
into considerable, if speculative, physiological as well as
psychological detail (see also, Washburn, 1914; Boodin,
1921). Washburn's ideas did find some corroboration in the
electrophysiological studies of Jacobson (1932), and seem to have
motivated the beginnings, in the 1930s, of research into the
effectiveness of the so called <em>mental practice</em>
(or <em>imaginary practice</em>) of motor skills (Janssen &amp;
Sheikh, 1994 p. 2).  Since these beginnings, much research has been
done on <em>mental practice</em> (e.g., Richardson, 1967; Ryan &amp;
Simons, 1982; Feltz &amp; Landers, 1983; Driskell <em>et al</em>., 1994;
Nordin <em>et al</em>., 2006), and, although its effectiveness remains
controversial (Budney <em>et al</em>., 1994; Weinberg, 2008), it is,
in fact, now very extensively used in high level sports and athletics
training (Murphy, 1994; Morris <em>et al</em>., 2005; Jedlic <em>et
al.</em>, 2007). However, in academic psychology, by the time
Washburn's 1916 book was published Behaviorist iconophobia was already
taking firm hold. Her sort of imagery theory would soon be largely
forgotten, until the relatively recent re-emergence
of <em>enactive</em> theories
(see <a href="index.html#BeyPicPro">section 4.5</a> of the main
entry). </p>

<p>

It should be said that most of the avowedly Behaviorist theorists and
researchers who succeeded Watson (who had given up his academic 
career by 1920, and published his last significant psychological work
in 1930) did not reject talk of inner psychological processes quite 
as vehemently as he had done. Thus, for instance, the covert 
&ldquo;fractional anticipatory goal responses&rdquo; of Hull (1931, 
1937), the &ldquo;cognitive maps&rdquo; of Tolman (1948), and the 
&ldquo;representational mediation processes&rdquo; of Osgood (1952, 
1953) all seem to have played at least some of the explanatory roles 
that earlier, mentalistic psychologists assigned to images. Most 
psychologists of the Behaviorist era simply avoided talking about 
imagery, but there is one important exception. Although he avoided 
using imagery as an explanatory construct, B.F. Skinner (probably the
most famous and influential theorist of the later decades of 
Behaviorism, and arguably a more radical and consistent Behaviorist 
even than Watson), nevertheless accepted that imagery 
<em>experiences</em> were not something that could simply be denied 
or dismissed (as Watson had attempted to do): Some sort of 
Behavioristic explanation of them was required. In his 
<em>Notebooks</em> (1980, p. 160), Skinner briefly describes his own 
experiences of auditory, musical imagery, and in his influential 
<em>Science and Human Behavior</em> (Skinner, 1953), he discusses, in
a speculative way, the causes of what he calls &ldquo;conditioned 
seeing&rdquo; and &ldquo;operant seeing&rdquo; (1953 ch. 17), which 
are clearly intended as non-mentalistic ways of referring to the 
experiencing of imagery, that will not violate Behaviorist 
principles. In his <em>About Behaviorism</em> (1974), Skinner 
reiterates essentially restates his earlier position, but allows 
himself to speak more freely of &ldquo;visualizing,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;imaging,&rdquo; and &ldquo;seeing in the absence of the thing 
seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

But, although he describes it as &ldquo;perhaps the most difficult 
problem in the analysis of behavior&rdquo; (1953 p. 265), the 
significance of Skinner's attempts to grapple with the experience of 
imagery should not be overstated. Unlike many other aspects of his 
theoretical work, his remarks on imagery never seem to have become 
the basis of a sustained experimental research program on the topic 
(by Skinner himself, or by any of his numerous followers). Indeed, 
his discussions (1953, 1974) seem designed to explain the phenomenon 
away, to show that it does not threaten basic Behaviorist 
commitments, rather than to examine it as a topic of scientific 
interest in its own right. The focus is, on the one hand, to insist 
that the occurrence of quasi-perceptual experience in no way 
constitutes evidence for the existence of mental representations (or 
anything else mental), and, on the other hand, to consider the sorts 
of circumstances, the &ldquo;contingencies of reinforcement,&rdquo; 
which might cause such experiences to arise for a particular 
individual at a particular 
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupAmeRes3" name="note-SupAmeRes3">3</a>]</sup>
 Skinner holds that instead of thinking of imagery as a 
&ldquo;thing&rdquo; we should instead think of visualization (and, 
indeed, seeing) as a form of behavior (albeit a largely or completely
covert behavior, hidden from casual observation somewhere under the 
skin of the organism). However, this positive view is sketched 
extremely lightly, and, apart from a very passing allusion to eye 
movements, he tells us little or nothing about the specific forms 
that such visualization behavior might take, and sets out no 
systematic evidence to support his suggestions.</p>

<p>

According to Paivio (1971), the 1920s and 1930s (when Watson's 
influence was at its height) were &ldquo;the most arid period&rdquo; 
for imagery research, but Kessel (1972) reports that even through the
1940s and 1950s a scant <em>five</em> references to imagery are to be
found in <em>Psychological Abstracts</em>. Admittedly some interest 
in the psychology of imagery continued outside the United States 
through these decades. In Britain, for example, psychologists such as
Pear (1925, 1927), Bartlett (1927, 1932), and, latterly, McKellar 
(1957) kept a degree interest in the topic alive, and when Place 
(1956) made his influential philosophical case for the identification
of conscious experience with brain processes, mental imagery was one 
of his main examples of mental phenomena that would not yeild to a 
purely behavioral analysis. However, these discussions of imagery did
not have much contemporaneous impact on psychologists in the United 
States (which by the 1930s had already achieved its dominant 
superpower status in psychology). A general revival of interest in 
the topic did not get under way in America before the 1960s. By that 
time the iconophobic consensus was beginning to break down due both 
to internal strains and external attacks. On the one hand, we find 
Mowrer (1960a, 1960b, 1977), Sheffield (1961), and others attempting 
to patch-up Behaviorist learning theory by reintroducing the concept 
of the mental image in an explanatory, representational role. On the 
other hand, we see new and striking empirical findings about imagery 
emerging to play a significant role in the so called Cognitive 
Revolution, that was soon to break the Behaviorist hegemony over 
scientific psychology (Gardner, 1987). Before long there was very 
little audience for Taylor's (1973) attempt to devise an explicitly 
Behavioristic theory of imagery. (In any case, Taylor identifies 
mental images with memory engrams in the brain, a move which both 
Watson and Skinner, at any rate, would surely have rejected as 
thoroughly unbehavioristic.)</p>
