<h2>Founders of Experimental Psychology: Wilhelm Wundt and William James</h2>

<p>

Wilhelm Wundt, acclaimed as &ldquo;the father of experimental 
psychology&rdquo;, established the first psychological research and 
teaching laboratory within the Philosophy Department at Leipzig in 
around 1876 (Fancher, 1996). He regarded his psychology as a branch 
of philosophy, an attempt to apply the experimental methods of 
natural science (particularly, the physiology of Helmholtz) to 
essentially philosophical problems concerning the nature of mind and 
its metaphysical status. This view of the subject persisted, in 
Germany, at least until the Nazi era. Wundt's research program aimed 
to investigate the &ldquo;elements of consciousness,&rdquo; and the 
laws governing the combination of these elements (Wundt, 1912). 
Although his theoretical system made a place for emotional 
<em>feelings</em> as one class of element, in practice the main focus
of Wundt's experimentally based research program was on the elements 
of <em>sensation</em> and their compounding into <em>ideas</em>. As 
has been the case in the Empiricist philosophical tradition, these 
<em>ideas</em> were conceived of as, to all intents and purposes, 
mental images. Indeed, Wundt insists, much in the spirit of Hume, 
that there is no fundamental difference in kind between the ideas 
arising directly from perception and &ldquo;memory images&rdquo; 
(Wundt, 1912). Thus, Wundtian experimental psychology was largely a 
study of cognitive processes, and, for him (and most of his numerous 
students and imitators), the mental image (under the rubric 
<em>idea</em>) played essentially the same crucial, representational 
role in cognition that it had played for most of his philosophical 
predecessors.</p>

<p>

Wundt's American counterpart, and contemporary, William James, took a
not dissimilar view, although he was careful to acknowledge that in 
some people the &ldquo;thought stuff,&rdquo; as he called it, might 
consist not so much of <em>visual</em> imagery as of imagery of other
modes, especially the &ldquo;verbal images&rdquo; of inner speech 
(James, 1890 ch. 18). In his textbook <em>The Principles of 
Psychology</em> (1890) James has much that is insightful to say about
psychological processes in general, and about the role of imagery in 
them in particular, but, although he presented experimental 
demonstrations in the course of his psychology teaching at Harvard, 
James had little interest in the actual pursuit of experimental 
research, and established no graduate teaching program in 
experimental psychology (Fancher, 1996). Thus, despite the lucidity 
of his justly famous text, and the wide readership it has continued 
to find, his direct influence on the disciplinary development of 
scientific psychology, even in his native America, probably never 
equaled that of Wundt (or even lesser German pioneers, such as G.E. 
M&uuml;ller), who trained many Americans (as well as many Germans, 
and students of other nationalities) in the techniques of 
experimental research. Just around this time, when psychology was the
latest intellectual fashion, the American Universities were 
undergoing a tremendous expansion. Thus many of these students were 
able to return from Germany to the United States to found 
experimental psychology teaching programs of their own. It was 
because of this, much more than the intellectual influence of James, 
that the U.S.A., well before it grew into a dominant world power and 
achieved its current leadership in the sciences generally, quickly 
grew to rival, and eventually surpass, Germany's initial preeminence 
in scientific psychology.</p>

<p>

Although psychologists of this era have often been portrayed (notably
by Boring (1950)) as using an introspective methodology, in fact 
Wundt, in particular, was very sensitive to standard criticisms of 
introspection, such as the contention that the very attempt to 
observe our own mental activities will itself alter them. He thus 
limited its use to situations where he was satisfied that the causes 
of the relevant mental events, the experimental stimuli, could be 
strictly controlled and the results shown to be replicable, with any 
introspective reports being made unreflectively, as soon as the 
relevant content appeared in the mind (Mischel, 1970; Danziger, 
1980). Wundt's research did <em>not</em> rely upon discursive 
descriptions of mental contents. An &ldquo;introspective&rdquo; 
report in his laboratory might typically have involved no more than 
indicating the moment when a certain sensation entered consciousness,
or saying whether a musical tone seemed higher or lower than the one 
presented just before. Such &ldquo;introspective reports&rdquo; 
differ little from the sorts of responses that might be called for in
many modern cognitive psychology experiments. Wundt's methodological 
discipline meant that the data collected in his laboratory were 
primarily such things as reaction times or discrimination thresholds,
rather than introspective accounts of inner contents or processes; it
also meant, in practice, that his experiments were restricted almost 
entirely to the study of &ldquo;lower&rdquo; psychological processes,
principally sensation and perception. Thus, although Wundt did hold 
that &ldquo;higher&rdquo; mental process, such as thought and memory,
depended largely upon mental images (including verbal imagery, silent
speech), in practice his experimental work did little directly to 
illuminate these. &ldquo;Higher&rdquo; mental processes, for Wundt, 
were best investigated non-experimentally, via a methodology that he 
called <em>v&ouml;lkerpsychologie</em>, a hermeneutic study of 
cultural products to which he devoted much of his later career, but 
which never achieved anything like the influence of his 
experimentally based work.</p>
