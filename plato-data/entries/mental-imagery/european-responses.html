<h2>European Responses: Jaensch, Freud, and Gestalt Psychology</h2>

<p>

In Germany, some psychologists responded to the crisis engendered by the
<a href="index.html#ImaThoCon">imageless thought controversy</a> by turning 
away from the experimental study of &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; questions
about the workings of the mind in general, and moved instead toward 
an understanding of their subject as concerned with interpretive 
studies of persons, or the differences between them. They, generally,
became more interested in their subjects' dispositions, values, 
motives, etc. than in either their imagery (unless, perhaps, its 
contents were interestingly idiosyncratic) or their 
<em>bewusstseinslagen</em> (if any such existed) (Danziger, 1980).</p>

<p>

An exception is the work of Jaensch (1930) on <em>eidetic</em> imagery
(see
 <a href="quasi-perceptual.html">Supplement: Other Quasi-Perceptual Phenomena</a>).
  Unfortunately, although Jaensch's
work has not been without influence, and aspects of it may be of
continuing scientific value, it is tainted by his enthusiasm for the
Nazi racist ideology that was then taking hold in Germany. Eidetic
imagery, he claims (on very meager evidence), is characteristic of the
less developed minds of not only children, but also members of
&ldquo;southern,&rdquo; &ldquo;sun adapted&rdquo; (i.e. darker
skinned) races. (Jaensch later won notoriety for performing an
experiment designed to show that &ldquo;northern&rdquo; chickens are
racially superior &ndash; as evidenced by more careful and intelligent
pecking &ndash; to &ldquo;southern&rdquo; ones (Ash, 1998).)  Stripped
of its openly racist elements, his theory lives on in, for instance,
Kubler&#8217;s (1985) suggestion that, because of their
&#8220;primitive&#8221; condition, adult paleolithic people (unlike
modern adult humans) retained the childlike ability to have eidetic
images, and that this accounts for the verisimilitude of their cave
paintings. Likewise, Miller (1931) (overtly influenced by Jaensch, but
without sign of racism) regarded eidetic imagery (not, I think,
clearly distinguished from mental imagery in general in this era) as a
&#8220;primitive&#8221; form of thought, normal in young children, but
likely to associated with psychosis and psychotic hallucination if it
appears more than very rarely in adult experience.</p>

<p>

Indeed, the belief that imagery (as opposed to verbal thought) is more
characteristic of minds that are somehow defective or undeveloped was
not confined to, and did not originate with, the Nazis and their
sympathizers; it seems to have been widespread in the early 20th
century. In 1912, a distinguished British psychiatrist apparently
thought it quite uncontroversial that there is a "predominance of
verbal thought in civilised man, and of concrete imagery in more
primitive races" (Mapother, 1912 p. 73). Likewise, the most famous
psychiatrist of the age, Sigmund Freud (certainly no Nazi), seems
implicitly to have regarded the visual images reported by his patients
as part and parcel of their neuroses, as something to be exorcized and
replaced, as far as possible, by verbally mediated,
&ldquo;rational&rdquo; insights (Esrock, 1994 ch. 3; Martin, 2007
p. 204). Furthermore, according to Jay (1993), in France (and, by
implication, to a large extent in continental western Europe in
general) 20th century intellectual life, across the political
spectrum, was permeated by a &ldquo;denigration of the visual&rdquo;:
visually based thought and experience was actively disvalued in
comparison to other modes of sense experience and to verbally mediated
thinking (cf. Levin, 1993; Fox Keller &amp; Grontkowski, 1983). Such
European attitudes were mirrored in the Anglophone world, especially
the United States, by the so called &#8220;Behaviorist
iconophobia&#8221; that gripped American psychological science for
most of the first half of the century, leading many psychologists to
either deny the existence of mental imagery altogether, or to almost
entirely ignore it (see supplement:
 <a href="american-response.html" target="other">The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery</a>).
 The discipline of philosophy was also
largely in the grip of such attitudes for much of the 20th century
(see <a href="index.html#ImaTweCen" target="other">&sect;3.3 of the main entry</a>).</p>

<p>

Arguably, signs of a similar attitude are evident some decades earlier
in England, in the responses Francis Galton received to his pioneering
questionnaire about mental imagery vividness. According to Galton,
unlike the regular folk he questioned, many of the scientists and
other intellectuals amongst his respondents were distinctly unwilling
to admit to ever experiencing (visual) mental imagery (Galton, 1880a,
1883; see also Roe, 1951). (More recent research, entirely contradicts
the implication, often drawn for Galton's findings, that scientists
tend to have weaker mental imagery than most other people, or may even
lack it altogether (Brewer &amp; Schommer-Aikins, 2006; see also Isaac &amp; Marks, 1994).
<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupEurRes1" name="note-SupEurRes1">1</a>]</sup>)
 It  is hard to say how widespread such attitudes were, or how they 
originated (or why they now seem to have 
 faded<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupEurRes2" name="note-SupEurRes2">2</a>]</sup>)
 but they may well have contributed to the sharp decline in serious
interest in imagery that is apparent, from the early
decades of the 20th century, not only in psychology but also
philosophy (see Heil, 1998 p. 213; Ny&iacute;ri, 2001) and literary
studies (Esrock, 1994). Only quite recently have there been signs
of a revival of philosophical interest in the possibility that imagery
might play a major role in cognition (e.g. Rollins, 1989; Ellis, 1995;
Thomas, 1997b, 1999b, 2006; Heil, 1998; Ny&iacute;ri, 2001; Prinz,
2002; McGinn, 2004; Arp, 2005, 2008).  </p>

<p>

Many other German psychologists, in the wake of the imageless thought
controversy, continued to adhere to the Wundtian ambition of 
developing an experimental science of the mind, and returned to 
something like the sort of methodological caution in the use of 
introspective reports that Wundt himself had advocated, often 
insisting on the direct corroboration of introspective evidence by 
observable effects on behavior (Danziger, 1980). This usually meant 
that, as with Wundt himself, although their experimentally based 
psychology did not explicitly repudiate the essential role 
traditionally assigned to imagery in thought and memory, in practice 
it had rather little to say about it. (Plausible behavioral 
correlates of imagery processes were not established until the rise 
of the cognitive psychology movement.)</p>

<p>

Perhaps the most influential movement arising from this strand of 
German psychological thought was Gestalt Psychology. It was also 
perhaps the last German bred movement to make a major impact in the 
United States, where it became a sort of &ldquo;official 
opposition&rdquo; to the indigenous and dominant Behaviorism. This 
was facilitated by the fact that, under the pressure of the rising 
tide of German Naziism, a significant number of Gestalt Psychology's 
adherents &ndash; including the acknowledged leaders, Max Wertheimer,
Wolfgang K&ouml;hler, and Kurt Koffka &ndash; emigrated to America 
during the 1920s and 30s (Ash, 1998). Gestalt Theory attempted to 
explain &ldquo;higher&rdquo; thought processes in terms of a sort of 
hypothetical neuroscience (<em>field theory</em>) rather than in 
terms of the vicissitudes of introspected thought contents (Thomas, 
1987; Ash, 1998). Although the Gestalt psychologists were much 
concerned with the experimental investigation of subjective 
experience (from whence they sought most of the evidential support 
for their views), in practice this research focused almost entirely 
on <em>perceptual</em> experience. The typical Gestaltist experiment 
sought immediate, unreflective descriptions of the appearance of a 
carefully constructed stimulus (frequently complex and illusional), 
and preferentially used subjects na&iuml;ve to the theoretical views 
and concerns of the experimenter. This was something very unlike the 
deliberate &ldquo;looking within&rdquo; practiced by psychologically 
sophisticated, trained introspectors in the laboratories of 
Titchener, K&uuml;lpe, and their students and peers. In certain 
respects Gestalt psychology foreshadowed, and, indeed, importantly 
influenced, the cognitivist movement of recent decades (Gardner, 
1987). Nevertheless, it had little directly to say about the nature 
or function of imagery.</p>
