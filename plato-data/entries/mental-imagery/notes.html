<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Mental Imagery</a></h2>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  One might ask, however,
 why closing one's eyes or turning one's head away should not count as
 choosing not to see the elephant. Also, our voluntary control over
 our imagery should not be overstated.  Notoriously, if someone is
 commanded <em>not</em> to imagine an elephant, almost inevitably
 they <em>will</em> imagine one; and some images, very often
 particularly distressing ones, can be very hard to voluntarily
 dismiss (see Thomas (2014 &sect;&sect;4-5) for elaboration of these points).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>  Indeed, some argue that
imagery plays a vital and ineliminable epistemological role in certain
scientific (and perhaps, also, philosophical) thought experiments,
some of which have played a crucial role in the development of modern
science (Brown, 1991; Gendler, 2004; Georgiou, 2007). Giaquinto (1992,
1993) also argues that visualization can sometimes play a crucial role
in <em>mathematical</em> discovery.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  On this point I have
relied upon the expertise of Professor Edward Slingerland of the
Department of Asian Studies at the University of British Columbia,
who supplied the reference.  Further corroboration comes from the
story of the 16th century Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who
attempted to introduce European imagery based mnemonic techniques
(see <a href="ancient-imagery-mnemonics.html">Supplement: Ancient Imagery Mnemonics</a>)
 into China (Spence, 1985). Although the
Chinese scholars were not especially impressed with the practical
utility of the elaborate system Ricci presented (they were prepared
to believe that it would work, but thought it unlikely to repay the
effort needed to learn it) there is no hint that they found the
concept of imagery itself in the least unfamiliar or puzzling.
</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  Modern scholarly
discussions of Aristotle's concept of <em>phantasia</em> include those
of Brentano (1886/1977), Beare (1906), Ross (1923), Benardete (1975),
Engmann (1976), Frede (1992), Lycos (1964), Modrak (1986, 1987),
Nussbaum (1978), Philippe (1971), Rees (1971), Roth (1963), Schofield
(1978), Todd (1981), Watson (1982, 1988), Wedin (1988), White (1985),
Turnbull (1994), Caston (1996), Niarchos (1997-8), and Birondo
(2001). General histories of the concept of imagination, that cover
Aristotle's seminal contribution, include those of Brann (1991), Bundy
(1927), Cocking (1991), Kearney (1988), White (1990), and Thomas
(1999a).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 Although the <em>Treatise of Man</em> was written relatively early in
Descartes&#8217; philosophical career, before the 
<em>Meditations</em>, and was not published during his lifetime, 
there is ample evidence in later material such as the <em>Passions of
the Soul</em> (1649) and the <em>Conversation with Burman</em> 
(1648), that he did not repudiate these views, and that they 
continued to shape his thinking to the end. Furthermore, when the 
treatise was posthumously published it seems to have had a 
considerable influence, and, for a while, may well have been more 
widely read than more purely philosophical works such as the 
<em>Meditations</em>, where the &quot;clear and distinct ideas&quot; 
of the intellect are treated. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 <em>Animal spirit</em> may be identified with what is now called 
<em>cerebro-spinal fluid</em>, a clear liquid that bathes the brain 
and spinal cord. The name <em>animal spirit</em>and the notion that 
it is centrally involved in brain function, and, indeed, in the 
processes of thought, goes back at least to the Roman physician 
Galen, and was widely accepted through the middle ages and 
Renaissance (Woolam, 1957; Finger, 1994). Thus, although Descartes' 
neural hydraulics may have been fairly original, the idea of 
<em>animal spirit</em> was quite conventional. Today, cerebro-spinal 
fluid is held to have an essentially nutritive function for the 
brain, and not to play any direct role in any cognitive or otherwise 
mental processes. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 The retinal image had, at this time, only relatively recently been 
discovered. Johannes Kepler first described it in 1604 (Lindberg, 
1976). Descartes had the <em>Treatise of Man</em> ready for 
publication in 1633. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 Descartes held that the pineal gland was full of animal spirit, under
pressure, and that the optic nerve (and other sensory nerves) acted 
upon it via small threads running down the center of each nerve 
fibre. The pull of a thread would cause a pore to open in the surface
of the gland, so that animal spirit was allowed to flow out of the 
gland, and through the hollow nerve fibre, into the brain. It is the 
pattern of such open pores in the gland surface that supposedly 
comprises the image there. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 In fact, he says it is the seat of &quot;imagination and common 
sense&quot;. &quot;Common sense,&quot; however, is not used here in 
its modern colloquial sense, but refers instead to the Aristotelian 
notion of a faculty or power of the soul (explained mainly in <em>De 
Anima</em> III, 2) whereby the deliverance of the various sense 
organs are brought together into a coherent, unified perceptual 
experience of the world (Beare, 1906; Ross, 1923; Kahn, 1966; Kosman,
1975; Nussbaum, 1978; Modrak,1981, 1987; Everson, 1997). Likewise, 
Descartes held that not only visual experience, but other sensory 
experiences too, were mediated by movements of the pineal gland that 
were in turn caused by the flow of animal spirit through its surface,
under control of the sensory nerves. Aristotle is often, and 
plausibly, interpreted as understanding this <em>common sense</em> to
be very closely bound up with, if not identical to, the 
<em>phantasia</em> or imagination (<em>De Insomniis</em> 459a 15-20),
which is said to be responsible for imagery. When it functions in 
perception it is appropriately called the <em>common sense</em>, and 
when it functions in remembering or imagining something, producing 
imagery, it is called the imagination. Thus, although Descartes may 
be highly original in the way he mechanizes and anatomically locates 
these functions, he is not being at all original or controversial in 
linking them. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 Spelling, capitalization and emphasis are all as in the original. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 Very much the same is said in Hobbes' <em>De Corpore</em> (Chap. XXV,
7, in Calkins, 1963).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 See also <em>De Corpore</em> (Chap. XXV, 7, in Calkins, 1963). 
Perhaps Hobbes thought of these motions as vibrations that could die 
away gradually: at any rate, he seems to have believed light to be a 
form of vibration (<em>Human Nature</em>, chap. 2, in Calkins, 1963),
so it would make sense for it to induce vibratory motion in the 
brain. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 Scientists would continue to be <em>called</em> &quot;natural 
philosophers&quot; for some time. The <em>Oxford English 
Dictionary</em> does not record any use of the word 
&quot;scientist&quot; before 1834, and its coinage and popularization
is often attributed to Whewell (1840). However, the distinction 
between what we now respectively call science and philosophy was 
recognized in practice long before that (Gjertsen, 1989). Indeed, it 
was marked (and perhaps in part initiated) by Locke himself, when he 
promised not to &quot;meddle with the physical consideration of the 
mind,&quot; (<em>Essay</em> I.i.2), and described himself as a mere 
&quot;under-labourer&quot; to Newton and the other great scientists 
of his age (<em>Essay:</em> Epistle to the Reader). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 The word &quot;imagery&quot; occurs just once in the <em>Essay</em> 
(II.x.5), and its direct reference is to carvings or other designs on
tombstones. However, the point of the passage is to draw an analogy 
between the &quot;mouldering away&quot; of this imagery with time and
the gradual fading of ideas from our memory. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 It is true that Locke holds that ideas originate not only from 
&quot;sense&quot; but also from &quot;reflection,&quot; i.e., 
introspection upon the workings of our mind itself. However, in all 
relevant respects he understands this reflection as just another 
perceptual sense, an &quot;internal sense&quot; (<em>Essay</em> 
II.1.4) that just happens to be directed inwards toward the workings 
of our minds rather than outwards toward the world around us (Ayers, 
1991 p. 49). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 Berkeley did think that we could <em>use</em> our inherently 
particular ideas to represent generals, i.e., classes of things, as a
geometrician might draw a diagram containing some particular straight
line of some particular length to illustrate a theorem intended to 
apply to all straight lines of any length (<em>Principles</em>, 
Introduction XII). Thus, I might use a picture of Winston Churchill 
(or a pictorial idea of him, in my mind) to represent all British 
prime ministers, or all politicians, or all men, or whatever else I 
might chose. However, it is not clear that this move solves the 
problem of how we are able to think about classes of things. In order
to be able to decide to use my mental picture of Churchill to represent all 
prime ministers, surely I must <em>already</em> have a general 
concept of prime-ministerhood, or of the class of all prime 
ministers. If I do, it is not clear what I would gain by using an 
imaginal idea to represent this, and Berkeley's story does nothing to
illuminate the nature and origin of my (presumably non-imaginal) 
general concept of prime-ministerhood (or of <em>straight line of 
arbitrary length</em>, or whatever). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 Hume seems to use 'fancy' (derived from the Greek <em>phantasia</em>)
as nothing more than an alternative name for the mental faculty more 
commonly known by the Latinate term 'imagination.' Although some 
medieval and renaissance authors may have suggested distinct 
cognitive roles for <em>imaginatio</em> and <em>phantasia</em> the 
distinctions they were attempting to draw never really seem to have 
caught on (Clarke &amp; Dewhurst, 1972; Harvey, 1975). After Hume's 
time, Coleridge (1817) used the two terms to draw a distinction 
between the truly creative <em>imagination</em> and the merely 
associative <em>fancy</em>, but, despite its fame, this distinction 
never caught on very widely either, and 'fancy,' in the relevant 
sense, is now largely obsolete. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 Another passage in the <em>Enquiry</em> is, in a way, even more 
explicit: </p>
<blockquote>
Our mental vision or conception of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to
us by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object, and raise
up its image in the fancy, it is not the will which creates that idea: It is
the universal Creator, who discovers it to the mind, and renders it present to
us. (<em>Enquiry</em> VII.1)
</blockquote>
<p>

Unfortunately exegesis of this is complicated by the fact that Hume 
is here describing a theory (probably Malebranche's) that he wants to
reject. Hume certainly does not think that God is directly 
responsible for rendering our ideas present to us. However, there is 
no hint that he is in anything but full agreement with the metaphor 
of &quot;mental vision&quot; and the notion that to think of an 
object is to &quot;raise up its image in the fancy.&quot; </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 Some of Reid's arguments may require only that <em>ideas</em> be 
understood as representational entities. However, he frequently 
states that his predecessors did think of their ideas as images 
(e.g., 1764 2.III), and chapters 7 and 9 of the second <em>Essay on 
the Intellectual Powers of Man</em> (1785), go to some pains to pin 
this doctrine on Locke and others. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 Bloor (1983) goes so far as to suggest (though without citing any 
evidence) that the later work of Wittgenstein largely grew out of the
reaction to the imageless thought affair. Certainly one of the 
leading W&uuml;rzburg school researchers, Karl B&uuml;hler, became a 
prominent psychology Professor in Vienna during the inter-war years, 
and Wittgenstein is known to have met him there, and seems to have 
been very struck (probably unfavorably) by his views (Toulmin, 1969; 
Bartley, 1973). B&uuml;hler also taught, and deeply influenced, the 
young Karl Popper (Popper, 1976), and undoubtedly his views would 
also have been quite familiar to the Vienna Circle positivists. (In 
the German speaking world at this time, the fields of philosophy and 
psychology were still closely institutionally as well as 
intellectually entwined.) </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>  Ever since Galton
(1880a, 1883) published his pioneering work on individual differences
in imagery experience, it has been &ldquo;well known&rdquo; that some
small minority of otherwise normal people report that they do not
experience visual imagery at all. However, this phenomenon remains
very poorly understood. Galton's evidence is essentially anecdotal,
and his interpretation of his findings seems to be distinctly suspect
(Brewer &amp; Schommer-Aikins, 2006; Burbridge, 1994). Since his time,
no systematic, quantitative research seems to have been done on
&ldquo;non-imagers&rdquo; (although see Sommer (1978) and Thomas
(1989) for case studies of individuals, and Faw (1997, 2009) for
personal testimony and discussion). Even the incidence, in the general
population, of people who deny that they experience imagery, remains
unknown (figures ranging from 10-12% (Abelson, 1979) to &ldquo;less
than 2%&rdquo; have been suggested, but I have been able to locate no
sign of an objective basis for any of these estimates). Despite this,
both Danto (1958) and Lawrie (1970) insinuate that Ryle's views on
imagery are only explicable if he was a &ldquo;non-imager&rdquo; of
the sort described by Galton. Hannay (1971) (although he soon
retreats) floats the same notion with regard not only to Ryle, but
also to Shorter and Sartre. (Others have, reductionistically,
attempted to explain even historical philosophical disputes, such as
those amongst the 18th century Empiricists about the properties of
ideas, in a similarly <em>ad hominem</em> way, as arising from
individual differences in the vividness of imagery experienced by the
parties involved (Fraser, 1891; Berman, 2008). Of course, there is no
independent evidence whatsoever that these parties actually did have
the postulated subjective differences in their imagery experience.)
Similar <em>ad hominem</em> dismissals of anti-pictorialist arguments
can also be found amongst contemporary psychologists. Kosslyn, for
example, speculates that the leading anti-pictorialist psychologist,
Pylyshyn, may be &ldquo;one of the few (&hellip;) people who does not
experience imagery&rdquo; (see &ldquo;What Shape Are a German
Shepherd's Ears?&rdquo; in
 <a href="index.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>,
 which is also the source for the &ldquo;less than 2%&rdquo; estimate
 for the proportion of non-imagers in the general population; and
 c.f. Lewis, Borst &amp; Kosslyn (2011 p.259)). Pylyshyn has responded
 to this with a direct denial (see &#8220;What Shape Are a German
 Shepherd's Ears?&#8221; in
 <a href="index.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>), although, in fact, an
 attentive reading of his earlier writings on imagery would already
 have shown him frequently taking pains to make it clear that he in no
 way intends to cast doubt on the reality of imagery experience. There
 is some evidence that when people know relatively little about the
 theoretical issues and empirical evidence concerning imagery there is
 a correlation between their inclination to believe in inner pictures
 and the (introspectively reported) vividness of their imagery (i.e.,
 people with more vivid imagery are more likely to believe in inner
 pictures). However, this correlation disappears once they know more
 about the issues and evidence (Reisberg, Pearson, &amp; Kosslyn,
 2003). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 Sartre, indeed, is said to have experimented with the hallucinogenic 
drug mescaline as a young man, and to have not only experienced vivid
hallucinations during his actual &ldquo;trip,&rdquo; but also 
distressing hallucinatory &ldquo;afterflashes&rdquo; for a 
considerable time following it (de Beauvoir, 1960; Riedlinger, 1982).
As for Ryle, it is quite clear, particularly from chapter 3 of his 
<em>On Thinking</em> (1979), that although he did not regard all 
thought, or even all imaginative thought, as necessarily involving 
quasi-visual experience, he certainly accepted that it sometimes 
does. </p>

activity (e.g. Bugelski, 1970, 1971; Bugelski, Kidd, &amp; Segmen,

 Imagery values were determined by averaging the results of numerical 
ratings produced by many subjects filling out a specially designed 
questionnaire (Paivio, Yuille, &amp; Madigan, 1968). </p>

 The difference in memorability of the two sets of words is not in 
dispute. What has been much disputed, however, is whether the 
difference in <em>imagery value</em> (or imagability) really causes 
the differences in memory performance, or whether some other semantic
feature of the words (something highly correlated with, but not 
identical to, imagery value) is the true cause. For example, 
Richardson (1975) once held <em>concreteness</em> to be the main 
causally effective variable, but later changed his mind in the face 
of further evidence (Richardson, 1980 p. 93). Another suggestion is 
that the <em>predicability</em> of the nouns in question (i.e., 
&ldquo;the ease with which what they refer to can be described by 
simple factual statements&rdquo;) might be the true causally 
effective parameter (Jones, 1986). Measures of predicability 
correlate quite well with imagery value, and it is quite plausible 
that more predicable words might spontaneously give rise to more 
extensive networks of verbal associations that might account for 
their greater memorability. In fact, upwards of thirty such 
alternatives to imagery value have been proposed over the past few 
decades, but the consensus seems to be that none of them has proven 
able to account for the full range of the empirical evidence as 
accurately and comprehensively as imagery value itself (Marks, 1997; 
see also Paivio, 1983a, 1991a, 2007). 
Nevertheless, it is clear, if only from the fact that so many 
alternative explanations have been proposed, that doubts about 
Paivio's imagery based explanation of his experimental data remain 
persistent and deep rooted. These doubts may be partly motivated by 
lingering doubts about the very reality of imagery, but the more 
important motivation is probably a commitment (itself motivated by 
broader theoretical or metatheoretical considerations) to some 
version of a <em>common coding</em> view of mental representation 
(see 
 <a href="theories-memory.html">Supplement: Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory</a>).

 In the article that kicked off the analog/propositional debate 
(Pylyshyn, 1973) the expression &quot;propositional 
representation&quot; was restricted to computational representational
schemes based on predicate calculus notation. However, the expression
came to be applied, by Pylyshyn and others, much more widely in later
discussions. The advantage of the term 'proposition,' in this 
context, is that it emphasizes the point that what is being 
contemplated are <em>not</em> natural language sentences (i.e., 
sentences of English, Russian, Chinese, Latin, or whatever), not the 
sort of natural language <em>verbal</em> mental representations 
advocated by theorists such as Paivio (1971, 1986), but, rather, 
unconscious computational representations of unknown lexicon and 
syntax (perhaps identifiable with the <em>deep structure</em> 
representations of sentences of Chomskian linguistic theory). 
Unfortunately, as noted, this usage is importantly different from 
what 'proposition' has long meant to philosophers (Gale, 1967). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 The word 'analog' was originally mainly associated with the views of 
Shepard, who played an important role in the earlier stages of the 
debate, and who may have been envisaging truly analog processes, as 
in an analog computer (Shepard, 1975, 1978b, 1981, 1984; Shepard 
&amp; Cooper <em>et al.</em>, 1982). However, although his 
experimental findings remain important, Shepard's theoretical ideas 
have long since been overshadowed, in the development of the debate, 
by those of Kosslyn. Since the later 1980s Kosslyn has been more 
concerned with the neuroscience of mental imagery than with the 
computational model that was central to his earlier work, but there 
is no reason to think that this has made his theory any more analog, 
and, in fact, he rarely uses the term. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 In the same year, some very similar arguments were independently made
by Anderson &amp; Bower (1973). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 Most defenders of the analog/pictorial theory of imagery, such as 
Kosslyn, Thompson &amp; Ganis (2002), do not dispute that imagery is 
cognitively penetrable. Their quarrel is with other aspects of 
Pylyshyn's argument. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>  Of course, there had
previously been other suggestions for non-pictorial accounts of
imagery, most notably the attentional theory of Ribot (1890, 1900),
the motor theories of Dunlap (1914), Washburn (1916), and Wekker
(1966), the behaviorist theory of Taylor (1973), and
the <em>enactive</em> (or <em>perceptual activity</em>) theories of
Hebb (1968), Hochberg (1968), and Sarbin &amp; Juhasz (1970; Sarbin,
1972). However, none of this work had very much impact in its time,
and, even today, few are aware of any of it. As far as I am aware,
no-one ever seriously contemplated the notion that mental images might
not be picture-like entities before the late 19th century. In more
recent times, however, not only description theories of the kind
advocated by Pylyshyn, but also more developed forms of enactive
theory, have begun to receive some attention. Enactive theories will
be discussed in
 <a href="index.html#EnaThePerIma">section 4.5.1</a>.
 </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>  Pylyshyn (1973) also
makes this argument, although he does not cite either Shorter or
Dennett. They all argue that mental images can be indeterminate or
inexplicit in what they represent, in a way that pictures cannot
be. Perhaps the clearest and best known example of the argument is
that of Dennett (1969 pp. 135-7; cf. Chisholm, 1942), who claims that a
mental image of a tiger may be quite inexplicit as to the number of
stripes it shows, whereas any picture of a tiger would have to show a
particular, countable number of stripes. Of course, a description of a
tiger could perfectly easily be inexplicit in the relevant way,
perhaps by just saying something like, "It has several stripes." Thus,
it is argued, mental images are in some important way, more like
descriptions than like pictures.<br />  For some reason, this argument
continues to get trotted out, even though numerous critics have
pointed out several serious flaws in it (Price, 1953; Hannay, 1971;
Fodor, 1975; Shepard, 1978b; Block, 1981a, 1983b; Lyons, 1984; Tye,
1991; Cohen, 1996), and few if any attempts have been made to rebut
these critiques (Simpson (1985) is an exception, but of limited
scope). For one thing, is by no means clear that mental images really
are inexplicit or indeterminate in the relevant sort of way. Just
because one may not, in practice, be able to count the stripes on
one's tiger image, it does not follow that it does not have a
determinate number of stripes. Several things well short of actual
indeterminacy, such as the tendency of images to fade from
consciousness quite quickly, might prevent one from
counting. Furthermore, it is not clear that it is really the case that
pictures cannot be inexplicit in the relevant way (consider, for
example, a rough, impressionistic sketch of a tiger, or a blurred
photograph). Frankly, given the complicated and irregular pattern of
tiger markings, it is not at all clear to me that even an actual tiger
has a determinate number of stripes (certainly I do not want the job
of counting them). Fortunately for Pylyshyn, he is able to marshal
several other arguments against picture theory, so neither his
case <em>against</em> picture theories of imagery, nor his
case <em>for</em> the description theory, depends upon this argument
from image indeterminacy. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
 Pylyshyn (1973) also discusses alternative suggestions from other 
sources about how visuo-spatial descriptions might be represented 
computationally, and does not attempt to advocate one such scheme 
over another. However, to the best of my knowledge, only Simon, 
Baylor, and Moran were, at this time, explicitly and publicly 
claiming that such representations were models of <em>mental 
imagery</em>. Pylyshyn makes it clear that it was Baylor's work, 
especially, that inspired him. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>  In fact Fodor (1975)
did not address Pylyshyn's work at all. However, he argues against
Dennett's (1969) version of the &quot;inexplicitness&quot; (striped
tiger) objection to mental pictures at some length (see note 31,
above), and briefly criticizes the homunculus objection. </p>

 Although Finke's work in this area is perhaps the most striking, 
other experimenters have also found that certain specifically visual 
effects, such as illusions and aftereffects, normally induced by 
specific visual stimuli, can be induced by appropriate mental imagery
(Erickson &amp; Erickson, 1938; Barber, 1959; Pressey &amp; Wilson, 
1974; Kunen &amp; May, 1980; Wallace, 1980, 1984; Berbaum &amp; 
Chung, 1981; Kosslyn, Sukel, &amp; Bly, 1999). However, some of these
findings (including some of Finke's) have not replicated reliably 
(Broerse &amp; Crassini, 1980; Reisberg &amp; Morris, 1985), and many
if not most of the results are very vulnerable to the criticism that 
they may reflect the <em>demand characteristics</em> 
 (<a href="demand-characteristics-problem.html">see supplement</a>)
 of the experiment rather than genuine cognitive mechanisms (Harris, 
1982; Broerse &amp; Crassini, 1984; Predebon &amp; Wenderoth, 1985), 
or else they are open to alternative explanations that are more 
consistent with description theory (Pylyshyn, 2002a, 2003b), a point 
that Finke himself now seems to accept (1989 ch. 2). Despite this, 
however, the threat these results pose to description theory may not 
have been entirely defused (Thomas, 1987, 1999b), especially as much 
neurophysiological evidence now points in the same direction. </p>

 Neisser (1967) had been an influential pioneer of the application of 
the computer metaphor to psychology, but by or before 1976 he had 
come to have serious reservations about it. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a>
 At this time virtually all computer monitors were CRT (Cathode Ray 
Tube) displays, and Kosslyn sometimes describes the theory as based 
upon a &quot;CRT display metaphor.&quot; </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-39" name="39">39.</a>
 Since the mid 1980s Kosslyn has turned more and more to neuroscience 
rather than computational modeling, both as a theoretical idiom and 
as a research strategy (see 
 <a href="quasi-pictorial.html">Supplement: The Quasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery</a>).
 However, there is little sign that he has thereby abandoned the 
functionalist commitments of his earlier work. Kosslyn &amp; Hatfield
(1984), reaffirm a commitment to functionalism, and even to 
computationalism broadly conceived, even while critiquing the 
symbolic computer programming idiom in which Kosslyn's earlier 
theoretical work had been couched. Kosslyn's more recent work on 
imagery can be seen as an exploration of just how and where the 
various component functions of his original computational theory 
(revised in certain details) might actually be implemented in the 
brain. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a>  The underlying
similarity of these diversely expressed theories is recognized by
Morris &amp; Hampson (1983), Thomas (1987, 1999b), and Hochberg
(2001). Unfortunately, however, it was little recognized at the time
most of the versions were being proposed, so the terms suggested here
to describe them are all more or less anachronistic:
&quot;enactive&quot; comes from No&euml; (2004) (although he does not
apply it explicitly to imagery), and is applied to imagery theory by
Thomas (2009, 2014), Sima (2011, 2013, 2014; Sima &amp; Freksa, 2012),
and Troscianko (2010, 2013, 2014a,b); &quot;sensorimotor&quot; comes
from Newton (1993, 1996) and O'Regan &amp; No&euml; (2001); and
&quot;perceptual activity&quot; from Thomas (1999b), Blain (2006), and
Agnati <em>et al.</em> (2013). De Preester (2012), although she refers
to the recent work of Thomas, and of O&#8217;Regan &amp; No&euml;,
mostly favors the older term, &#8220;motor theory&#8221;. Morris &amp;
Hampson (1983), who were perhaps the first to recognize the common
theme in some of these theoretical proposals, refer to them as
&quot;role playing theories,&quot; but this is not a very happy choice
of terminology.  Although Sarbin and Juhasz (Sarbin &amp; Juhasz,
1970; Sarbin, 1972) explicitly make theoretical use of the concept of
role playing (or &#8220;role taking&#8221;), this is not true to any
significant degree of any of the other theorists in question (and
certainly not Neisser (1976, 1978a,b), whose views are actually the
main focus of Morris &amp; Hampson's discussion). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a>
 Others, such as Janssen (1976b) and Morgan (1979) show signs that 
they were thinking along similar lines, but they never developed the 
relevant ideas very far. Shepard (1978b), with his remarks about 
imagery as perceptual anticipation, and Paivio, when he says that 
imagery is akin to &quot;active perception&quot; (1977), may also be 
leaning in this direction. Certainly both Shepard and Paivio 
repudiate computational models. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a>  Perhaps relevant
answers may also be sought in the information carried by in internal
formations, such as the sensorially generated activation pattern in
the retina, or the cochlea of the ear, or in the brain's
retinotopically mapped visual cortex, (Thomas, 1999b, 2009).  Such
activation patterns are not (<em>pace</em> Kosslyn)
<em>mental</em> representations (Meijsing, 2006): there is no reason
to believe (and good reason to disbelieve) that they bear
intentionality or that they are suitable for manipulation as
representational tokens in thought processes or computations, and, as
modern neuroscience shows (Lamme <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Rees, Krieman,
&amp; Koch, 2002; Koch, 2003 ch. 6; Meyer, 2011) they are not
inherently conscious states. Nevertheless, they bear information about
the layout of the environment, much as a shadow does, or an optical
image in a <em>camera obscura</em>, and thus may be interrogated by
internal active perceptual processes in a way analogous to that in
which our external sense organs interrogate the information bearing
formations (such as the <em>optic array</em>) in the external
environment itself (Thomas, 1999b, 2009). There is growing evidence
that this sort of internalized active perception really does occur,
both in vision (e.g., Li <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Reynolds &amp;
Chelazzi, 2004; Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Serences &amp; Boynton,
2007; Kveraga <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Gilbert &amp; Sigman, 2007;
David <em>et al.</em>, 2008; McAlonan <em>et al.</em>, 2008;
Bressler <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Kelly <em>et al.</em>, 2008;
Munneke <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Jehee <em>et al.</em>, 2011;
McManus <em>et al.</em>, 2011), and in other sense modes (Fritz <em>et
al.</em>, 2003, 2005; Zelano <em>et al.</em>, 2005, 2011;
Nitschke <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Samuelsen <em>et al.</em>, 2012). This
converging evidence comes from both fMRI and other studies on human
subjects (non-invasive, but low spatial and temporal resolution
techniques) and from high-resolution studies on the activities of
individual neurons, using electrodes implanted in animal brains. There
are good reasons to believe that these internal active-perception
processes (together with their external counterparts) play a key role
in generating conscious perceptual experience (Marcel, 1983; Lamme
&amp; Roelfsema, 2000; Pascual-Leone &amp; Walsh, 2001; Gilbert &amp;
Sigman, 2007; Gaillard <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Meyer, 2011). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a>
 Although perceptual information processing presumably entails much 
activity in a perceiver's brain, this is conceived to be mainly 
driven &quot;bottom-up&quot; by the sensory input. It is thus not 
<em>action</em>, not something done by the organism, but rather
something that happens to it. Thus it would not lend itself to being
intentionally <em>re-enacted</em> in the sense envisaged by enactive
imagery theories. (In practice most versions of information processing
theory make some appeal to a top-down as well as a bottom-up flow of
information, but the latter is always seen as primary, with the
top-down component merely modulating the bottom-up flow. The notion
that the process is driven by the information flowing inward, from
periphery to center, remains the defining characteristic of theories
of this sort.) </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a>
 It is no accident that Neisser's enactive theory of imagery draws 
heavily on Gibson's (1966) theory of perception, which firmly 
rejected the information processing perspective (and, indeed, 
cognitivism in general). However, although Gibson had some 
enthusiastic followers, they were, and have remained, a small and 
embattled minority amongst perceptual psychologists (and few of them,
apart from Neisser, have taken much interest in imagery). </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a>  It has been shown
that &quot;active perception&quot; behavioral routines of the sort
discussed here can (under conditions of simulated natural selection)
spontaneously evolve in simple robotic systems, enabling the robot to
use a quite rudimentary endowment of sensory transducers to make
surprisingly subtle and complex perceptual distinctions (Nolfi &amp;
Floreano, 2002). The sense of perceptual presence that such a system
is claimed to support has been called the &quot;immanence
illusion&quot; (Minsky, 1986), the &quot;refrigerator light
illusion&quot; (Thomas, 1999b; Block, 2001, 2007), and even the
&quot;grand illusion&quot; (No&euml; &amp; O'Regan, 2000; No&euml;
<em>et al.</em>, 2000). However, No&euml;, while fully endorsing the
underlying concept, in fact argues that it is misleading to think of
this as an <em>illusion</em> (2002, 2004).  This is what perceptual
presence <em>is</em>. </p>

<p>
 <a href="index.html#note-46" name="46">46.</a>  A number of related
findings point in the same direction:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>There is also now
considerable evidence to suggest that the eye movements of REM sleep
(or some of them) are enactments of the movements that would be made
if the dreamer were actually seeing the things being dreamed
about. Early findings to this effect (Dement &amp; Kleitman, 1957;
Dement &amp; Wolpert, 1958; Schiff <em>et al.</em>, 1961;
Roffwarg <em>et al.</em>, 1962; Berger &amp; Oswald, 1962) were met
with some skepticism, and proved difficult to replicate (Moskowitz
&amp; Berger, 1969; Jacobs <em>et al.</em>, 1972; Koulack, 1972; Firth
&amp; Oswald, 1975). However, more recent research, using the much
improved eye-tracking technology available today, seems to have
largely removed the reasons for doubt, and to have confirmed the
original claims (Herman <em>et al.</em>, 1984; Hong <em>et al.</em>,
1997, 2009; Doricchi <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Sprenger <em>et al.</em>,
2010; Leclair-Visonneau <em>et al.</em>, 2010; see also Hobson,
2009).</li>

<li>Bensafi <em>et al.</em> (2003) found that when
people are imagining particular
<em>odors</em> they spontaneously sniff in a way that re-enacts the 
distinctive sniffing pattern observed when they actually smell an 
odor of that type.</li>

<li>Some researchers have found that, under the right conditions, the
tracking (as opposed to saccadic) eye movements made when visually
following a moving stimulus are also re-enacted when imagining such a
motion (Antrobus, Antrobus, &amp; Singer, 1964; Deckert, 1964; Brown,
1968; de&#8217;Sperati &amp; Santandrea, 2005) (however, others
(Lenox <em>et al.</em>, 1970; Zikmund, 1972) have disputed these
claims).

<li>Ruggieri &amp; Alfieri (1992) found that the
crystalline lens of the eye behaves in imagery as in perception,
focusing further away when objects are imagined as far away, and
closer when objects are imagined as close.</li>

<li>Laeng &amp; Sulutvedt (2013) have recently found that the pupil of
the eye contracts when imagining brightly illuminated scenes and
dilates when imagining more dimly lit ones, thus enacting what it does
when we actually see scenes of different brightnesses.</li>

</ol>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a>  Although the human
retina as a whole takes in light from a visual solid angle of about
200&deg;, the fovea, the central part of the retina, which has the
greatest visual acuity (because it is where the light sensitive cells
are packed most closely together), and where most of the color
sensitive cone cells are found, only receives light from about 2&deg;
of visual angle, &ldquo;about the size of a thumbnail at arm&rsquo;s
length&rdquo; (Richardson &amp; Spivey, 2004). Despite this, it seems
to be the fovea that does the lion&rsquo;s share of the work of normal
human perception, under good lighting conditions (i.e., not darkness
or semi-darkness, when low acuity, monochrome, rod-vision takes
over). Although the fovea occupies only about 1% of the entire retinal
surface, about half of the retinotopic map in primary visual cortex
(V1) is devoted to it (Petersen &amp; Diamond, 2001). Thus, our
ability to recognize objects and colors in peripheral vision
(i.e. using just parts of the retina outside the fovea) is quite
limited. Most of the cone cells are in, or fairly close to, the fovea,
and, as one moves outwards into the periphery, they soon become very
sparsely distributed. The light sensitive cells in the peripheral
retina are not only relatively widely spaced (and so unable to resolve
much detail), but are mostly rods, which do not register color at all,
and which do not function except in low light (Curcio <em>et al.</em>,
1987, 1991; Roorda &amp; Williams, 1999; Roorda <em>et al.</em>, 2001;
Conway, 2009). Thus, the ability of regions of the human retina to
distinguish colors (and significant detail) falls off rapidly as we
move outwards from the fovea, and color vision seems to disappear
altogether beyond about 70&deg; from the foveal center (Wooten &amp;
Wald, 1973). (The main function of daytime peripheral vision seems to
be the detection of movement, which attracts the attention, and
usually leads to the making of a saccade that brings whatever is
moving into foveal vision, where it can be recognized.) We only
experience our visual world as rich in detail and color throughout
because we normally (unconsciously) saccade to new fixation points,
focusing new regions onto the fovea, several times every second
(Richardson &amp; Spivey, 2004; Holmqvist <em>et al.</em>, 2011). (See
Thomas (2014 &sect;5) for a more extensive discussion of the modern
science of eye movements and its implications for the philosophy of
perception and imagination.) Thus, if mental images were
quasi-pictures, equivalent to &ldquo;retinal snapshots&rdquo; taken
during the brief intervals of eye fixation (relative stillness) that
occur between major saccades (as Kosslyn usually seems to hold), only
a very small part of any image would appear detailed and colored. This
does not seem to match most people's imagery experience, and does not
appear to be consistent with most accounts of the cognitive properties
and functions of imagery. In response to this problem (and to the
findings of Laeng &amp; Teodorescu (2002) concerning eye movements
during imagery), Mast &amp; Kosslyn (2002b) suggest that our imagery
of a visual scene may consist not of a single retinal snapshot, but,
rather, of a sort of montage of the foveal parts of a whole series of
such snapshots, &ldquo;pasted together&rdquo;, as it were, to create
an image of the scene as a whole:</p>

<blockquote> One possibility is that eye movements are stored in
memory along with the images [i.e., quasi-pictures] that were encoded
at each fixation. If so, then eye movements might play an important
role in allowing one to visualize a montage, a composite created on
the basis of memories of multiple fixations. That is, eye movements
could trigger sequences of memories and could also help us to position
correctly each image of a part of the field relative to other
parts. (Mast &amp; Kosslyn, 2002b p. 271; see also Kosslyn, 1994
p. 250).</blockquote>

<p>

However, despite the fact that this proposal appears to be a
significant departure from earlier versions of quasi-pictorialism,
Kosslyn scarcely mentions it in his subsequent theoretical writings,
such as his 2005 review article, or his most recent book on imagery
(Kosslyn, 2005; Kosslyn <em>et al.</em>, 2006), and it is not at all
clear that it is consistent with other important aspects of his
theory, such as the accounts given elsewhere (Kosslyn, 1980, 1994) of
mental scanning (a phenomenon of central theoretical importance for
Kosslyn), of the fading of images (see Sima, 2014 p. 43), and his
claim to have measured the &ldquo;visual angle of the mind&rsquo;s
eye&rdquo; as encompassing about 30&deg; (Kosslyn, 1978a). It also
seems to be at odds with current ideas about how it is that we
normally see the world as essentially stable, despite the fact that
the image on the retina (and thus also its representation in the
retinotopic maps of the early visual system) constantly jitters about,
changing frequently, rapidly, and irregularly as the eyes move. The
subjective stability of most of what we see implies that the immediate
object of visual experience is not (as Kosslyn&rsquo;s theory of the
visual buffer would suggest) these retinotopic representations, but
the world itself (which, thankfully, mostly does remain stable as our
eye movements sample its details). Furthermore,</p>

<blockquote>Little is carried over from one fixation to the next; we
do not build a visual world by pasting together samples calibrated
with efference copy, but simply perceive what is currently available,
plus a gist and a few previously attended objects. (Bridgeman, 2010

<p>If vision itself does not involve the &ldquo;pasting

&ldquo;montage&rdquo; of the larger scene, it hardly seems likely that
visual imagery would work that way. </p>

 <a href="index.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a>
 The points are not unconnected. Thomas (2006) argues that the 
concepts of <em>consciousness</em> and <em>imagination</em> are much 
more closely connected with one another than is commonly realized; 
that, indeed, before the 17th century, <em>imagination </em>occupied 
a very large part of the conceptual space since taken over by 
<em>consciousness</em>. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-49" name="49">49.</a>
 Aristotle, who may well be said to have invented the concept of 
imagination (Juhasz, 1971; Schofield, 1978; and see Rees, 1971 n.7), 
defined it [<em>phantasia</em>] as &quot;(apart from any metaphorical
sense of the word) the process by which we say that an image is 
presented to us&quot; (<em>De Anima</em> 428a). During later 
antiquity, the Aristotelian concept of <em>phantasia</em> developed 
into the richer Latin concept of <em>imaginatio</em> (which became 
our <em>imagination</em>) (Watson, 1988; Cocking, 1991). Virtually 
every philosopher, from ancient times until well into the 20th 
century, implicitly accepted Aristotle's definition (White, 1990 part
1; Brann, 1991; Thomas, 1999a), and most modern dictionaries still 
say something similar. The currency of the idea that imagination is 
the source of artistic creativity (and, latterly, creativity in other
spheres, such as science (e.g., Tyndall, 1872; Van't Hoff, 1878; 
Brown, 1991; Holton, 1996; Gendler, 1998; Georgiou, 2007)) is largely due to the 18th
and 19th century Romantic movement; although the idea has been traced 
back as far as Flavius Philostratus' <em>Life of Apollonius of 
Tyana</em> (6 &sect;16, in Conybeare, 1912), written in the 3rd century 
A.D. (Saintsbury, 1900; Osbourne, 1968; Cocking, 1991; see also 
Kearney, 1988). The connection here with imagery remains strong. 
Philostratus (or Apollonius, whose words are supposedly being 
reported) argues that, as opposed to simply producing a likeness of a
living model, when a sculptor produces a statue of a god whom he 
has never actually seen, he must be relying upon his imagination 
(i.e., he must form a mental image to stand in place of the living 
model). It is clear that both Philostratus and the Romantic theorists
of imagination continued to believe that 'imagination' 
<em>primarily</em> means the power to produce or experience imagery 
(Robson, 1989; Brann, 1991). For Coleridge (1817) the power of 
artistic creativity is, quite explicitly, &quot;secondary 
imagination.&quot; </p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-50" name="50">50.</a>
 In <em>The Concept of Mind</em> (1949), Gilbert Ryle declared that 
&quot;There is no special Faculty of Imagination, occupying itself 
single-mindedly in fancied viewings and hearings&quot;, and in the 
latter half of the 20th century such deflationary views of the 
imagination (perhaps in reaction to its earlier <em>in</em>flation by
Romanticism) became commonplace amongst analytic philosophers (see Thomas, 2014). Not 
only was the faculty <em>qua</em> faculty called into question, but the very 
notion of imagining. Many late 20th century philosophers held, in 
effect, that 'imagine' is a polysemous verb, used to mean different, 
sometimes quite unrelated, things on different occasions: 
<em>visualize</em>, <em>think creatively</em>, <em>believe 
falsely</em>, <em>suppose</em>, <em>pretend</em>, and so on (e.g.: 
Flew, 1953; Strawson, 1971; Gross, 1973; Dix, 1985; Newton, 1989; Sparshott, 1990;
Walton, 1990; Stevenson, 2003). By contrast, White (1990 part 2) argued that 'imagine'
<em>does</em> have a true meaning &ndash; it means something like
&quot;think of as possibly being so&quot; &ndash; but that it has no
conceptual connection whatsoever with imagery. Views similar to
White's now seem to be quite widespread, though they are rarely
defended in any detail (if at all) (e.g.: Rorty, 1988; Nozick, 1993;
Johnson, 1993; Nichols &amp; Stich, 2000, Byrne, 2005).  Of course,
other contemporary philosophers of imagination do not share these
deflationary views (e.g.: Warnock, 1976, 1994; Brann, 1991; Thomas,
1999a; McGinn, 2004; Crowther, 2013), and the view that imagination is
a coherent concept, closely related to the concept of imagery, has
been explicitly defended by Thomas (1997a, 1999b, 2014) and Kind
(2001).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-51" name="51">51.</a>  This view also finds
some support in the arguments of Rowlands (2006a, 2006b) and Lycan
(2006). They argue that (despite what No&euml; (2004) and other
enactive theorists, such as Gibson (1966, 1979), have said) it makes
sense to think of enactive perception as giving rise to intentional
representations. These need not, however, be the sort of internal
symbolic tokens to which enactivists object. Sensorimotor activity
itself, it is suggested, can function representationally (Rowlands,
2006a, 2006b; see also Bickhard &amp; Richie, 1983; Heil, 1998 ch. 6;
Meijsing, 2006).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index.html#note-52" name="52">52.</a>
 But Paivio (1971, 1986), amongst others, holds that imagery can be at
work in our cognitive processes without our being consciously aware 
of it. The question is whether such <em>unconscious</em> perceptual 
representations deserve to be called mental images, and the answer 
will depend, at least in part, on whether one has a representational 
or an experiential concept of imagery (see 
 <a href="index.html#MeaConMenIma">section 1</a>).
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-53" name="53">53.</a>
Abell &amp; Currie (1999), however, argue, as simulationists, against
quasi-pictorial theory, and there is little sign that they are any
more sympathetic to &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; description theory
(see also Abell, 2005). Furthermore, Johansson <em>et al.</em> (2006)
interpret Barsalou's remarks about simulation as committing him to
some form of enactive theory. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index.html#note-54" name="54">54.</a>
 Fodor, of course, is the leading proponent of the view that all 
mental representation is, or depends upon, mentalese, the amodal 
<em>language of thought</em>. However, according to Cummins (1989) 
Locke (who, of course, shares Prinz's empiricist/perceptual view of 
concepts) also held a covariational theory of representational 
content.</p>

 Random dot stereograms were introduced by Julesz (1971) as a tool for
studying stereoscopic vision. An illustrative example (somewhat
imperfect, owing to the limitations of web graphics) is shown in
figure 1. The two sides of the stereogram are identical except that
the dots in a square region in the center of the left-hand image have
been shifted a little to the right as compared with those in the
right-hand image. This difference is too slight to be visible to even
quite careful inspection. However, when the stereogram is viewed
through a stereoscope so that the left-hand pattern is presented only
to the left eye, and the right-hand only to the right, they will fuse
into a single square percept with the central, shifted, square region
appearing raised in depth. Of course, the shifted area does not have
to be square, so other raised (or depressed) shapes can also be
obtained.</p>

<p>

According to Stromeyer (1970; Stromeyer &amp; Psotka, 1970), the
subject <em>Elizabeth</em> viewed one side of a million-dot
stereogram, and then was able to use her eidetic image of it to see
the three dimensional shape when presented with the other half of the
stereogram some four hours later. This would require, at a minimum, a
pixel perfect memory for the exact relative positions of several tens
of thousands of dots. She was also shown four different versions of
the right-hand part of a 10,000 dot stereogram (each with a different
shaped region shifted relative to the left-hand image), and then
<em>the next day</em> was shown the corresponding left-hand
pattern. It is reported that she was then able to use her eidetic
images of each of the four versions of the right-hand pattern, in
turn, to experience four differently shaped regions standing out in
depth. Given what is now known about the (relatively low) resolving
power of the various components of the human visual system (retina,
primary visual cortex, etc.) (Van Hooser &amp; Nelson, 2005; Petersen
&amp; Diamond, 2002), and given also that other accounts of eidetic
imagery describe the images as fading, and becoming irretrievable, a
minute or so after the original stimulus has been removed from view
(Haber, 1979), it is hard to understand how such feats could truly be
possible. Although there are well attested reports in the psychology
literature of other people with remarkable mnemonic abilities (with
what are popularly, though misleadingly, called "photographic
memories"), none of their genuinely impressive accomplishments
remotely resemble this feat ascribed to <em>Elizabeth</em> (Neisser,
1982 Part 7).</p>

least to Aristotle (<em>De Intrepretatione</em> 16a; <em>De

 But see Schwitzgebel (2004) for a qualified defense (and description)
of Titchener's introspective methodology. The reputation of Wundt, 
who did not use introspection of this now deprecated kind (Danziger, 
1979, 1980), has seen a considerable revival in recent decades (e.g. 
Blumenthal, 1975; Bringman &amp; Tweney, 1980; Fancher, 1996). </p>

<p>


 <a href="perky-experiment.html#note-SupPerExp2" name="SupPerExp2">2.</a>
 It is not apparent that Perky took any deliberate steps to induce 
relaxation in her subjects, but Segal found it essential. Segal 
attributes this difference in their findings to the fact that her 
subjects, unlike Perky's, were drawn from among &ldquo;the 
suspicious, pragmatic students who populated our campuses in the late
1950s and early 1960s&rdquo; (Segal, 1971b). Thanks to Orne (1962) 
and others, psychologists today are very much more alert than they 
once were to the need to take account of the social psychology and 
social context of the experimental situation when working with human 
subjects (see

 Furthermore, according to Brewer &amp; Schommer-Aikins

<em>not</em> truly supported by the actual data he gathered, as well
as being contradicted by the results of their own attempt to replicate

<h3>Notes to Supplement: The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery</h3>

<p>
<a href="american-response.html#note-SupAmeRes1" name="SupAmeRes1">1.</a>
Watson also mentions Fernald's (1912) work on <em>imagery types</em>
in this connection.  Many psychologists in this period believed that
people could usefully be classified into psychological types according
to the preferred or predominant sensory mode of their imagery. Thus
some people (&quot;visiles&quot;) might think mostly in visual
imagery, others (&quot;audiles&quot;) in auditory imagery, others in
motor or kinaesthetic imagery (&quot;motiles&quot;), and so on, and
these types might be expected to be found to correlate with individual
differences in cognitive abilities or personality (see Angell, 1906
chap. 8, p. 165). Fernald's findings indicate that the classification
of people into <em>imagery types</em> was likely to less
straightforward than had previously been realized, as the modes of
imagery people report are sensitive to situational and contextual
variables. I know of no evidence, however, that, when Watson was
writing, anyone but he saw Fernald's work as throwing the theory of
imagery types (let alone the very concept of imagery, or psychology
itself) into crisis. Neither Fernald herself, nor Titchener (1914)
seem to have thought it did, and certainly her work aroused nothing
like the widespread controversy of the imageless thought
debate. Fernald's work did perhaps pave the way for quite devastating
critiques of <em>imagery type</em> theory by the likes of Thorndike
(1914 ch. 16) and Griffits (1927).  The theory has never recovered
from those critiques, but they came later.</p>

<p>
<a href="american-response.html#note-SupAmeRes2" name="SupAmeRes2">2.</a>
Berman &amp; Lyons (2007) consider, but reject, the possibility that,
some time between 1908 and 1913, Watson may have been the victim of
some sort of neurological event that caused him to lose and forget his
former ability to experience mental imagery. There are several cases
described in the neurological literature in which people have lost
their onetime ability to consciously experience visual imagery, due to
some sort of brain damage, even though their perceptual abilities
remained relatively unimpaired (Brain, 1954; Basso <em>et al.</em>,
1980; Riddoch, 1990; Goldenberg, 1992; Young &amp; van de Wal, 1996;
Moro <em>et al.</em>, 2008). (The condition is sometimes referred to
as &#8220;Charcot-Wilbrand&#8221; syndrome, but this
inaccurate. Although it does seem to have been first described by
Charcot (Young &amp; van de Wal, 1996), the case of so-called &ldquo;mind
blindness&rdquo; described by Wilbrand in 1887 was, in fact, a case of
neurological visual impairment <em>without</em> accompanying loss of
imagery (Solms <em>et al.</em>, 1996).) In most of these cases,
however, the brain damage does give rise to other fairly obvious
cognitive impairments of some sort, none of which Watson seems to have
suffered from. However, more recently, Zeman <em>et al.</em> (2010)
have described a case in which a man apparently suddenly lost his
former ability to experience visual imagery (presumably due to a very
mild, virtually symptomless stroke) without showing any sign of other
significant impairments. It is not impossible that Watson may have
experienced a similar event. It remains unlikely, however, given
Watson's relatively young age at the time, and the fact that he does
not seem to have suffered from any further strokes or other
neurological problems around this time. Furthermore, unlike Watson,
Zeman&rsquo;s patient (in common, indeed, with the patients in the other
cases of neurological loss of conscious imagery, just mentioned) was
in no way inclined to deny that other people experience visual mental
imagery, or that he himself had once done so. Indeed, it was concern
about the change he noticed in his mental experience that let him to
consult a doctor about it, and so bring it to scientific
attention.</p>

<p>

 <a href="american-response.html#note-SupAmeRes3" name="SupAmeRes3">3.</a>
 Skinner, it should be said, resisted the reification of experiences 
in general quite as much as he resisted that of images in particular.

<h3>Notes to Supplement: Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory</h3>

<p>


 <a href="theories-memory.html#note-SupDuaCodComCodTheMem1" name="SupDuaCodComCodTheMem1">1.</a> 
That is not to say that Dual
Coding theory provides the only viable account of the selective
interference phenomenon. In fact, selective interference is also often
discussed in the light of the Working Memory theory of Baddeley (1976,
1994; Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974; Logie &amp; Baddeley, 1990).
According to this theory, the <em>working memory</em> system (roughly
equivalent to what other psychologists call <em>short term
memory</em>) consists of a <em>central executive</em> that controls a
number of semi-independent &ldquo;slave&rdquo; subsystems, the most
important of which are the <em>articulatory (and/or phonological)
loop</em> (that holds and manipulates verbal material in
consciousness) and the <em>visuo-spatial scratchpad</em> (that does
the same for imagery). Two tasks that simultaneously call upon the
same subsystem may be expected to interfere with each other.
Baddeley, unlike Paivio, does not seem to be committed to the storage
of imaginal and verbal memories in separate <em>long term memory</em>
stores. However, it is arguable that for many purposes, including the
explanation of selective interference and many mnemonic effects,
Working Memory theory and Dual Coding theory function not so much as
rival theories, but as <em>alternative formulations</em> of
essentially the same theoretical model (Marschark &amp; Hunt,
1989). </p>

<hr />

<h3>Notes to Supplement: Conceptual Issues in Dual Coding Theory</h3>

<p>

 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe1" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe1">1.</a>
 Codes are systems of representations, and in the context of the 
discussion of Dual Coding theory, we are talking about types of 
mental representation of which we can, at least potentially, be 
directly conscious, as we often <em>are</em> conscious of both 
imagery and of &ldquo;inner speech&rdquo;. None of the arguments made
in this section are intended to rule out the possibility that 
cognition might also involve other sorts of non-conscious 
representational codes. These might inlcude not only mentalese 
(conceived as the underlying code of our thought processes), but 
also, perhaps, specialized representational systems involved in the 
processing that (on some views) goes on within informationally 
encapsulated mental modules, including, perhaps, sensory processing 
modules (Fodor, 1983; Pylyshyn, 2003 b). </p>

<p>


 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe2" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe2">2.</a>
 A fully consistent defense of the unity and cohesiveness of the 
imagery code may not be entirely compatible with this sort of 
Empiricism. But although Paivio (1986) explicitly claims to be an 
Empiricist, this seems to be mainly a way of indicating his 
commitment to the primacy of the experimental method in science, as 
opposed to &ldquo;rationalistic&rdquo; methods like computer 
simulation. In fact, he explicitly rejects the <em>wax 
impression</em> metaphor that is central to the traditional 
Empiricist understanding of perception and imagery (and from which, 
of course, the very notion of a &ldquo;sense impression&rdquo; 
derives) (Paivio, 1977).</p>

<p>


 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe3" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe3">3.</a>
 The rejection of the Empiricist picture of perception, amongst both 
philosophers and cognitive scientists, takes many and various forms, 
but many recent theorists now view perception as an essentially 
active process of environmental exploration, and firmly reject the 
view of the senses as passive input channels (Gibson, 1966, 1979; 
Neisser, 1976; Bajcsy, 1988; Ballard, 1991; O'Regan, 1992; Blake 
&amp; Yuille, 1992; Aloimonos, 1993; Churchland <em>et al.</em>, 
1994; Akins, 1996; Landy et al., 1996; Thomas, 1999b; O'Regan &amp; 
No&euml;, 2001; No&euml;, 2002a, 2004, 2009). As applied to imagery (Thomas,
1999b), this appears to be consistent with Paivio's 
characterization of it as &ldquo;a dynamic process more like active 
perception than a passive recorder of experience&rdquo; (Paivio, 
1977).</p>

<p>

 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe4" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe4">4.</a>
McGinn (2004 pp. 27-8) claims that it is impossible to experience both
a visual and an auditory image simultaneously, because imagery depends
on attention and we cannot give the right sort of focal attention to
two different things at once. However, it seems to me that I <em>can
and do</em> have imagery experiences that are simultaneously visual
and auditory. For example, if I imagine a metal pan falling to the
ground, I can both "see" the fall and "hear" the crash. McGinn may
have made a case for thinking it is impossible (or very difficult) to
have two separate, unrelated images at the same time (regardless of
mode), but it does not necessarily follow that we cannot have unitary
imagery experiences with more than one sensory aspect.</p>

<p>

 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe5" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe5">5.</a>
 Aristotle (on a plausible and widely accepted interpretation of his 
texts) associated the imagination [<em>phantasia</em>], &ldquo;the 
process by which we say that an image [<em>phantasma</em>] is 
presented to us&rdquo; (<em>De Anima</em> 428a 1-4), not with the 
five special senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch) but with 
the so called &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; [<em>koine aisthesis</em>], 
the faculty of the soul through which the various deliverances of the
special senses are integrated into a coherent and meaningful whole 
(Beare, 1906; Ando, 1965; Nussbaum, 1978; Modrak, 1987). (Note that 
the Aristotelian concept of <em>koine aisthesis</em>, although it 
translates literally as &ldquo;common sense,&rdquo; is unrelated to 
the modern colloquial meaning of that expression.) The most direct 
textual evidence that Aristotle considered the imagination and the 
common sense to be fundamentally the same faculty is to be found in 
<em>De Insomniis</em> (459a) and <em>De Memoria</em> (450a). Kant's 
view of the relationship between imagination and perception seems, in
the relevant respects, to have been broadly similar to this (as, of 
course, are the views of a myriad other thinkers, past and present, 
directly or indirectly influenced by Aristotle). The Kantian 
imagination, the <em>einbildungskraft</em>, is primarily responsible 
for the synthesis of the manifold of experience (i.e., the 
deliverances of the individual senses) into a form that the 
understanding can grasp (Kant, 1781/1787 A120, B180-181, A141-142; 
see Strawson, 1971; Warnock, 1976). It should be noted that Paivio 
explicitly denies that there is an Aristotelian common sense (Paivio,
1986 p. 580). However, this is apparently because he interprets 
Aristotle as proposing something like the &ldquo;amodal&rdquo; 
mentalese representations of the sort championed by Pylyshyn (1978; 
1984). There are alternative (and, arguably, less anachronistic) 
interpretations of Aristotle's theory that Paivio might well find 
less objectionable (see, e.g., Kosman, 1975; Modrak, 1987).</p>

<p>


 <a href="dual-coding-theory.html#note-SupConIssDuaCodThe6" name="SupConIssDuaCodThe6">6.</a>
 1975 was the year in which Fodor published his book <em>The Language 
of Thought</em>, which introduced the concept of mentalese. It is 
sometimes suggested (though not, I think, by Fodor) that the familiar
feeling of having something, such as the answer to a question, 
&ldquo;on the tip of one's tongue&rdquo; amounts to a direct 
experience of a mentalese representation, equivalent to our 
experience of imagery. This does not stand up to examination, however.
It is true that
the hypothesis of the mentalese code enables a simple and appealing 
explanation of an otherwise somewhat puzzling phenomenon. If 
information is stored in and retrieved from memory in the form of 
mentalese, it will clearly need to be translated into a natural 
language (e.g., English) before it can be spoken or written down. On 
this basis, the <em>tip of the tongue</em> phenomenon may readily be
explained as arising from a successful episode of retrieval from 
storage, followed by a failure of the stage of translation into 
natural language. However, even if this is right, mentalese is still 
functioning as an <em>explanans</em> here, and not an 
<em>explanandum</em>. It may be arguable that, because the 
explanation is principled and fairly simple, the <em>tip of the 
tongue</em> phenomenon provides relatively direct experiential 
evidence for the reality of mentalese (as, say, Brownian motion 
provides relatively direct, easily observed evidence for the reality 
of molecules), but that is not at all the same as having direct 
experience of mentalese <em>per se</em> (any more than seeing 
Brownian motion through the microscope is seeing molecules). It is a 
far cry from the sort of direct, quasi-sensuous phenomenal experience
that we enjoy of imagery and inner speech. The <em>tip of the 
tongue</em> feeling may perhaps be best understood as one of those
vague and contentless <em>fringe consciousness</em> phenomena discussed 
by Mangan (2001). When we experience imagery (or 
inner speech) we are normally (perhaps even <em>ipso facto</em>) 
aware of its intentional content, of what is being represented. By 
contrast, it is of the essence of the <em>tip of the tongue</em> 
phenomenon that we are <em>not</em> aware of what (if anything) is 
getting represented. </p>

Whether the findings (mentioned in <a href="index.html#SpaProIma"
target="other">&sect;4.3</a>) on the &#8220;visual angle of the
mind&#8217;s eye&#8221; (Kosslyn, 1978a; Finke &amp; Kosslyn, 1980;
Finke &amp; Kurtzman, 1981a,b; Farah <em>et al.</em>, 1992) stand up
in the same way is much more questionable.  Intons-Peterson &amp;
White (1981), Banks (1981), and Thomas (2014 p. 153) all argue that
these findings may very plausibly be explained as the result of
experimental demand, and so do not reliably indicate genuine, inherent
features of visual mental imagery. Finke &amp; Kurtzman (1981c; Finke,
1989 ch. 2) however, attempt to rebut the critique. </p>

<h3>Notes to Supplement: The Quasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery</h3>

 Kosslyn does not claim that the specific, LISP-like format of deep 
representation shown in figure 4.4.2_1 is psychologically real. It is
just his illustration. Even today, little is known about how such 
information might actually be represented (if it actually is). </p>

 Kosslyn explicitly draws the analogy with the 2&frac12;D sketch (as 
described by Marr &amp; Nishihara (1978)) &quot;except that [the 
2&frac12;D sketch] is far too primitive and unorganized; a parsed 
2&frac12;D sketch would more closely approximate our surface 
representation&quot; (Kosslyn, 1980 p. 464; cf Kosslyn, 1994 p. 86). </p>

 It is perhaps worth noting again that not only is the functional 
architecture of Descartes' theory of visual perception and 
imagination (as presented in the <em>Treatise of Man</em> and the 
<em>Optics</em> (Descartes, 1664, 1637)) virtually identical to that 
of Kosslyn's theory, but also that the Cartesian mental image
functions as a merely <em>quasi</em> picture. Descartes insists that 
it is of no consequence whether the inner images of his theory 
(formed on the surface of the pineal gland, the Cartesian <em>visual 
buffer</em>) actually resemble the things they represent. All that 
really matters is that they are such as to stimulate the soul 
(functionally equivalent, in this respect, to Kosslyn's <em>mind's 
eye function</em>) in such a way as to cause it to have the 
appropriate experiences (<em>Optics: Discourse 4</em>; see Hyman, 
1986). Of course, it turns out that, despite these caveats, the 
Cartesian inner image is in fact a picture that resembles what it 
represents, being (during vision) a point-by-point projection of the 
retinal image upon the pineal surface. However, it also turns out 
that Kosslyn holds that when his quasi-picture is actually 
instantiated in the brain, it is rather more literally picture-like 
than the functional level theory demands (see next note). Pylyshyn 
(1981, 2002a, 2003b) argues that much of the superficial plausibility
of theories of this type depends upon this equivocation. They slide 
between making appeal to pictures in a fairly literal sense, and 
appealing to some notion of a quasi-picture (something that is not 
<em>really</em> a picture at all). The literal picture in the head 
theory is intuitively appealing, but clearly false, whereas the 
quasi-picture (not-really-a-picture) theory, while not so obviously 
false, has no more intrinsic intuitive appeal than explicitly 
non-pictorial views like Pylyshyn's own. </p>

 Retinotopic mapping refers to the way in which several visual 
processing areas of the brain (most notably, but not only, V1, the 
primary visual cortex), are structured as (rather distorted and low 
resolution) maps of the light sensitive retina upon which light is 
focused at the back of the eye (see Petersen &amp; Diamond, 2001). 
Adjacent regions of the visual cortex correspond to adjacent areas on
the retina such that, during vision, the two-dimensional spatial 
pattern of excitation of the cortical neurons corresponds 
topologically to the pattern of illumination in the optical image 
formed on the retina. If, as Kosslyn now holds, these retinotopic 
maps are the embodiment of his theory's <em>visual buffer</em>, this 
means that loci in the brain that represent the presence of the same 
sorts of features (e.g., the color, or the state of motion) of 
adjacent areas of an imagined visual scene will, after all, be (for 
the most part) physically adjacent in the brain. </p>

 Almost half of the retinotopic map in primary visual cortex (V1) is 
devoted to mapping the fovea, the small central part of the retina 
where the light sensitive cells are packed most densely and where 
most of the color-sensitive cone cells are found. However, the fovea 
is only about 1% of the entire light sensitive retinal surface 
(Petersen &amp; Diamond, 2001).<br /> </p>

 The mnemonic effects of imagery have also been demonstrated in the 
congenitally blind (Craig, 1973; Jonides <em>et al.</em>, 1975; 
Cornoldi <em>et al.</em>, 1979; Zimler &amp; Keenan, 1983). However, 
the congenitally blind cannot do absolutely everything that the 
sighted can do with their imagery (Arditi, Holtzman, &amp; Kosslyn, 
1988). Also, much of what they can do often takes more effort and is 
done more slowly (De Beni &amp; Cornoldi, 1998; Vanlierde &amp; 
Wanet-Defalque, 2004). Some argue that the congenitally blind may 
even experience <em>visual</em> imagery, especially in dreams 
(Keilkopf, 1968; Kaski, 2002; Aleman <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Lopes da 
Silva, 2003; B&eacute;rtolo, 2005). The more generally accepted view,
however, is that although people blinded later in life often continue
to experience visual imagery for many years, those blind from birth 
or early childhood do not. When they use visual language in 
describing their dreams and other imaginings, they are speaking 
metaphorically about their spatial understanding, or understanding in
general (Schlaegel, 1953; Berger <em>et al.</em>, 1962; Kirtley, 
1975; Kerr, 1993, 2000; Hurovitz <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Kerr &amp; 
Domhoff, 2004). There <em>is</em> evidence that visual cortex can 
become active when the congenitally blind experience imagery (Lambert
<em>et al.</em>, 2004; De Volder et al., 2001), but this may be 
because so called visual cortex takes on non-visual responsibilities 
in the blind (Kujala <em>et al.</em>, 1995; R&ouml;der <em>et 
al.</em>, 1995; Raz <em>et al.</em>, 2005). What is clear is that the
blind are quite capable of perceiving and understanding spatial 
structure and spatial relations through the use of their haptic and 
other senses (Brodey, 1969; Morgan, 1977; Casey, 1978; Landau, 
Gleitman, &amp; Spelke, 1981; Acredolo, 1983). Absent a prior 
commitment to picture theory, this seems quite sufficient to account 
for their spatial imagination abilities, and even their dreams (Kerr,
Foulkes, &amp; Schmidt, 1982; Thomas, 1987 &sect;II.B.6; Kerr &amp; 
Domhoff, 2004). </p>
