<h2>Conceptual Issues in Dual Coding Theory</h2>

<p>

Despite its impressive empirical successes, Dual Coding Theory has by
no means gained universal acceptance, and alternative explanations of
the relevant phenomena continue to be proposed and defended. Perhaps 
the most important reason for this is a perceived incompatibility 
between the theory (and the notion of mental representation it 
deploys) and the computational approach to the mind that many regard 
as fundamental to cognitive science. Paivio himself (1986) explicitly
rejects the idea that the human mind can be understood on the model 
of a computer, and presents Dual Coding Theory as the basis of an 
alternative approach to cognition. Nevertheless, an argument for a 
Dual Coding as opposed to a <em>common coding</em> account of memory 
performance is not <em>ipso facto</em> an argument against the 
computational view of the mind and the existence and theoretical 
necessity of a mentalese type code. Some cognitive scientists, 
conscious of the (in some respects, complementary) merits of both 
Dual Coding Theory and computationalism, would clearly like to 
reconcile the two viewpoints. It is worth considering whether or how 
this can be done in a satisfactory way.</p>

<p>

Before that, however, there are certain conceptual issues internal to
Dual Coding Theory itself that should be examined. Indeed, the 
concern that these have never been very adequately addressed (by 
Paivio or, indeed, anyone else) may well be another important source 
of dissatisfaction with the theory (Lockhart, 1987; but see Paivio, 2007). We will return 
in later sections to more general worries about the nature and 
possibility of imagery representation <em>per se</em>, but we should 
also ask just how we should understand the notion of a <em>code</em> 
(as Paivio uses 
 it<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe1" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe1">1</a>]</sup>),
 and about how such codes are to be differentiated, characterized, and
counted.</p>

<p>

Indeed, it seems obvious to some commentators (e.g., Kintsch, 1977;
Flanagan, 1984) that Paivio, through focusing too much on
<em>visual</em> imagery, has counted wrongly, and that if there is an
imagery code at all, there must be one for each of the senses: a
visual imagery code, an auditory one, an olfactory one, and so on.
Indeed, Flanagan (1984) always talks of &ldquo;six-code theory&rdquo;
rather than <em>dual coding</em>. This may not be an altogether
misleading characterization of Paivio's actual view &ndash; he
frequently refers to imagery as &ldquo;modality specific&rdquo;
representation &ndash; but he clearly regards the distinction by sense
mode between different types of image to be orthogonal to the more
central distinction of Dual Coding Theory, between the image and the
verbal (symbolic) codes. One might go even further than this (although
Paivio himself resists doing so) and argue that what we actually have
is a unitary, multi-modal imagery system, that handles auditory,
haptic, olfactory, etc. memories, as well as visual ones, in an
integrated way. We can certainly accept that non-visual aspects of our
imagery experience may play a much larger role in our mental life than
is commonly acknowledged (Newton, 1982) without endorsing the idea of
&ldquo;six-code&rdquo; theory. Despite the ingrained bias toward
focusing upon its visual aspect, it is quite plausible that imagery is
best understood as fundamentally multi-modal. Indeed, the idea that
mental images are, and must always remain, strictly segregated by
sense mode (such that images of different modalities might interact
associatively, but never merge) is compelling only if we regard the
senses as independent, segregated channels through which sense
impressions of different types are funneled into the mind, and if we
also think of mental imagery as arising <em>within</em> those sense
channels, or as directly derived from their immediate outputs. This,
of course, is the view of perception and imagery that has come down to
us from Empiricist philosophy: the perspective from which mental
images were taken to be either &ldquo;decaying sense&rdquo; (Hobbes,
1651), or copies of former sense impressions (Hume, 1740 p. 1; see
Matthews,
 1969).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe2" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe2">2</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>

This Empiricist view of perception continues to be very influential, 
but it is by no means universally accepted, and many arguments, both 
empirical and theoretical, have been advanced against it (Morgan, 
1977). 
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe3" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe3">3</a>]</sup>
 Some theorists, indeed, completely reject the idea of functionally 
independent senses, and argue that perception can only be correctly 
understood if the sense organs are viewed not as independent 
channels, but as components of a single, integrated,
perceptual system (Stoffregen &amp; Bardy, 2001; Walk &amp; Pick, 
1981; L.E. Marks, 1978; von Hornbostel, 1927). On this view, 
perceptual experience is inherently multi-modal (although, of course,
we often focus our interest on just one particular modal aspect of 
it), and there is every reason to think that quasi-perceptual 
experience, imagery, is the same (Thomas, 1987, 1999b n.6). From this
perspective, there is no justification whatsoever for segregating 
imagery codes by sense mode.</p>

<p>

However, even for those (no doubt the majority) who continue to 
conceive of the five (or so) senses as distinct and more or less 
passive input channels, it does not follow that <em>imagery</em> 
might not be multi-modal, that the sight and the scent of the rose 
that we imagine might not be best understood as aspects of a single, 
integrated imaginative experience rather than separate adventitiously
associated visual and olfactory
images.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe4" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe4">4</a>]</sup> After all, it is quite 
conceivable that the representations we experience as imagery, and 
that get stored in long term memory, might arise not in the sensory 
channels themselves, but, instead, are synthesized at or beyond the 
point where the deliverances of the senses are brought together to 
form our polysensory experience of the world. This is consistent both
with certain influential contemporary views about perception and 
imagery (e.g., Pylyshyn 1978, 1999, 2003b) and with some very 
traditional philosophical perspectives, such as those of Aristotle 
and 
 Kant.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe5" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe5">5</a>]</sup>
 (It might, however, be harder to reconcile with other influential 
contemporary views of the nature of imagery, such as Kosslyn's 
<em>quasi-pictorial</em> theory of visual imagery (1980, 1994). 
Kosslyn seems inclined to embrace some form of Dual Coding Theory 
(Kosslyn, Holyoak, &amp; Huffman, 1976; Kosslyn, 1994 p. 335), but 
perhaps he really ought to prefer the &ldquo;six-code&rdquo; 
version.)</p>

<p>

Let us now consider the <em>verbal code</em>. Paivio himself has 
always made it quite clear that he is thinking of inner speech (and 
the like) in natural language (in English, or whatever one's native 
tongue happens to be). However, as mentalese (or &ldquo;propositional
representation&rdquo;) came to play a key role in cognitive theory in
general, and, in particular, to displace covert speech as the central
theoretical concept of the dominant <em>common coding</em> view of 
memory, it seemed natural to some cognitive theorists to construe the
two codes of Dual Coding Theory as <strong>imagery and 
mentalese</strong> rather than <strong>imagery and English</strong> 
(Baylor, 1973; Kosslyn, Holyoak, &amp; Huffman, 1976; Kieras, 1978). 
In similar vein, Anderson (1983) suggested a <em>tri-code</em> 
theory, with imagery, verbal, <em>and</em> 
&ldquo;propositional&rdquo; memory codes.</p>

<p>

It is not clear to what extent the established empirical advantages 
of the imagery/English version of Dual Coding Theory (as an account 
of memory phenomena) would carry over to an imagery/mentalese version
(let alone a <em>tri-code</em> theory). However, quite apart from any
such concerns, and even if we think (as many do) that there are other
good and independent reasons to believe in the existence of a 
mentalese code, there are still problems with the imagery/mentalese 
version of Dual Coding. On any viable construal of Dual Coding Theory
, the two codes, whatever they might be, are on a par with one 
another, playing parallel and complementary explanatory roles. One 
would expect entities with such similar explanatory roles to also be 
on the same level within the theory's ontology. That seems to be the 
case for mental images and mental (natural language) words, but it 
does <em>not</em> seem to be true for images and mentalese 
representations. Both mental imagery and inner speech are familiar 
and common phenomena of conscious experience. They are psychological 
<em>explananda</em> as well as <em>explanantia</em>. By contrast, 
mentalese representations are <em>explanantia</em> only. Mentalese is
not a <em>phenomenon</em>. It is not directly experienced (if it were
it would surely have been known about long before 
 1975!).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#SupConIssDuaCodThe6" name="note-SupConIssDuaCodThe6">6</a>]</sup>
 Indeed, we have no reason whatsoever to think that mentalese exists 
<em>unless</em> we believe that it is essential for the adequate 
explanation of our cognitive powers. Many cognitive scientists 
<em>do</em> believe this, of course, but from their perspective there
are very good reasons to believe (and it <em>is</em> generally 
believed) that not just cognition in general, but imagery in 
particular cannot be fully explained without appeal to mentalese. 
Some hold that mentalese is necessary to account for the 
intentionality of imagery (Fodor, 1975; Rollins, 1989; Tye, 1991; 
Kosslyn, 1994 p. 6); others hold that mentalese descriptions are 
actually <em>constitutive</em> of imagery (Simon, 1972; Baylor, 1973;
Moran, 1973; Pylyshyn, 1978, 2002b, 2003b; Kieras, 1978; Hinton, 
1979). On either of these views, the imagery/mentalese version of 
Dual Coding Theory (and Anderson's <em>tri-code</em> theory) mixes 
ontological and explanatory levels in a disconcertingly awkward and 
asymmetrical way: on the one hand the mentalese code functions in the
theory as a more or less the equal partner of imagery, paralleling 
its role in the explanation of memory phenomena; on the other, 
mentalese is more fundamental, grounding the representational power 
of imagery, or perhaps even its very being.</p>

<p>

It may be possible, however, to reconcile some form of Dual Coding
Theory with computationalism (and its mentalese,
&ldquo;propositional&rdquo; representations) in a more elegant and
satisfactory manner. It has been suggested that <em>both</em> of
Paivio's codes, both mental images <em>and</em> mental words, might,
in a more or less symmetrical way, emerge from, be constructed on the
basis of, or otherwise be equivalently dependent upon, underlying,
unconscious mentalese representations (Morris &amp; Hampson, 1983;
Marschark <em>et al</em>., 1987; Marschark &amp; Hunt, 1989). Paivio's
actual position, after all, is that the elements of the verbal code
are themselves a form or imagery: auditory and/or vocal-motor images
of the spoken words of one's native language (or possibly occasionally
even visual images of written words) (Paivio, 1971, 1986 p. 57). If
this is the case, there seem to be least two elegant and principled
ways in which one might conceive of the relation between Paivio's
codes and mentalese. One might argue (following Pylyshyn) that just as
visual images are ultimately reducible to mentalese representations,
so too are the auditory (or whatever) images that constitute mental
words.  Alternatively, one might argue (following Fodor or Kosslyn)
that although imagery may not be <em>reducible</em> to mentalese,
nevertheless, all types of mental image, verbal or otherwise, can
function as mental <em>representations</em> only inasmuch as they have
semantic properties (meanings or intentionality), and they have these
semantic properties only in virtue of associated mentalese
representations. Although neither of these options are Dual Coding
Theory quite as Paivio conceives it (he firmly rejects
computationalism and Fodor style mentalese), they can bring
essentially the same explanatory resources to bear on the memory
phenomena that form the main evidentiary basis for the theory.</p>

<p>

But if verbal representations are themselves a form of imagery, as 
Paivio holds, another problem arises for Dual Coding Theory (quite 
regardless of whether one thinks its codes must somehow be 
underpinned by mentalese). All the relevant representations now seem 
to be imagery of some sort, and we have already argued that we should
not differentiate imagery codes on the basis of sensory modality. In 
what sense, then, can we now justify talking of two distinct codes? 
Paivio himself holds that the necessary duality arises because there 
is a greater degree of functional integration within codes than 
between codes (Paivio, 1986). The idea, apparently, is that 
associative connections between different verbal images are stronger,
or more numerous, or form a more richly interconnected network, than 
do associative connections between verbal images and non-verbal ones 
(and vice-versa). However, it is by no means clear that this 
difference of degree is an adequate basis for differentiating the 
codes, or even that it is real. After all, Paivio frequently insists 
(and the overall theory requires) that there are rich associative 
interconnections <em>between</em> the two codes, and is it by no 
means obvious (nor, to the best of my knowledge, is it empirically 
established) that, for instance, my mental image of the word 
&lsquo;cat&rsquo; is more strongly or richly associated with mental 
images of other <em>words</em> (&lsquo;fur,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;claws,&rsquo; &lsquo;meow,&rsquo; &lsquo;dog&rsquo;) than it 
is with mental images of cats, cat fur, cat claws, etc.</p>

<p>

There may, however be another way of suitably differentiating the
codes. Regardless of whether their representational power is
intrinsic, or is grounded in mentalese (or something else), non-verbal
images represent (or are normally taken or used to represent) whatever
they are images <em>of</em> &ndash; my image of the Eiffel Tower
represents the Eiffel Tower for me, my auditory image of the sound of
a trumpet represents the sound of a trumpet, and so on. By contrast,
verbal images (except for the rare occasions when we are thinking
<em>about</em> rather than merely <em>in</em> language) function
<em>symbolically</em>: they are not used to represent what they are
images <em>of</em> (i.e., some spoken or written word or words), but,
rather, what the imagined word or words <em>means</em> (whatever one
may take the <em>meaning</em> relation to be). My auditory image of
the words &lsquo;Eiffel Tower&rsquo; is not normally used to represent
the words &lsquo;Eiffel Tower&rsquo; (as they might be spoken on some
occasion), but, rather, the Eiffel Tower itself. Mental images (as
elements of the imagery code) represent what they are images
<em>of</em>; mental words (when functioning as elements of the verbal
code) represent what the words <em>mean</em>. The two codes thus
employ quite different representational modes. This is <em>not</em> a
mere difference of degree, and (although the matter needs further
exploration) it seems possible that it might be an adequate basis for
the duality that Paivio's theory requires.</p>
