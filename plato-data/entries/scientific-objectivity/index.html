<h1>Scientific Objectivity</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Aug 25, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>Scientific objectivity is a characteristic of scientific claims,
methods and results. It expresses the idea that the claims, methods
and results of science are not, or should not be influenced by
particular perspectives, value commitments, community bias or personal
interests, to name a few relevant factors. Objectivity is often
considered as an ideal for scientific inquiry, as a good reason for
valuing scientific knowledge, and as the basis of the authority of
science in society.</p>

<p>Many central debates in the philosophy of science have, in one way
or another, to do with objectivity: confirmation and the problem of
induction; theory choice and scientific change; realism; scientific
explanation; experimentation; measurement and quantification; evidence
and the foundations of statistics; evidence-based science; feminism
and values in science. Understanding the role of objectivity in
science is therefore integral to a full appreciation of these
debates. As this article testifies, the reverse is true too: it is
impossible to fully appreciate the notion of scientific objectivity
without touching upon many of these debates.</p>

<p>The ideal of objectivity has been criticized repeatedly in
philosophy of science, questioning both its value and its
attainability. This article focuses on the question of how scientific
objectivity should be defined, whether the ideal of objectivity is
desirable, and to what extent scientists can achieve it. In line with
the idea that the epistemic authority of science relies primarily on
the objectivity of scientific reasoning, we focus on the role of
objectivity in scientific experimentation, inference and theory
choice.</p>

<h2><a id="IntProProObj">1. Introduction: Product and Process Objectivity</a></h2>

<p>Objectivity is a value. To call a thing objective implies that it
has a certain importance to us and that we approve of it. Objectivity
comes in degrees. Claims, methods and results can be more or less
objective, and, other things being equal, the more objective, the
better. Using the term &ldquo;objective&rdquo; to describe something
often carries a special rhetorical force with it. The admiration of
science among the general public and the authority science enjoys in
public life stems to a large extent from the view that science is
objective or at least more objective than other modes of
inquiry. Understanding scientific objectivity is therefore central to
understanding the nature of science and the role it plays in
society.</p>

<p>Given the centrality of the concept for science and everyday life,
it is not surprising that attempts to find ready characterizations are
bound to fail. For one thing, there are two fundamentally different
ways to understand the term: <strong>product objectivity</strong> and
<strong>process objectivity</strong>. According to the first
understanding, science is objective in that, or to the extent that,
its products&mdash;theories, laws, experimental results and
observations&mdash;constitute accurate representations of the external
world. The products of science are not tainted by human desires,
goals, capabilities or experience. According to the second
understanding, science is objective in that, or to the extent that,
the processes and methods that characterize it neither depend on
contingent social and ethical values, nor on the individual bias of a
scientist. Especially this second understanding is itself
multi-faceted; it contains, <em>inter alia</em>, explications in terms
of measurement procedures, individual reasoning processes, or the
social and institutional dimension of science. The semantic richness
of scientific objectivity is also reflected in the multitude of
categorizations and subdivisions of the concept (e.g., Megill 1994;
Douglas 2004).</p>

<p>If what is so great about science is its objectivity, then
objectivity should be worth defending. The close examinations of
scientific practice that philosophers of science have undertaken in
the past fifty years have shown, however, that several conceptions of
the ideal of objectivity are either questionable or unattainable. The
prospects for a science providing a non-perspectival &ldquo;view from
nowhere&rdquo; or for proceeding in a way uninformed by human goals
and values are fairly slim, for example.</p>

<p>This article discusses several proposals to characterize the idea
and ideal of objectivity in such a way that it is both strong enough
to be valuable, and weak enough to be attainable and workable in
practice. We begin with a natural conception of objectivity:
<strong>faithfulness to facts</strong>, which is closely related to
the idea of product objectivity. We motivate the intuitive appeal of
this conception, discuss its relation to scientific method and discuss
arguments challenging both its attainability as well as its
desirability. We then move on to a second conception of objectivity as
<strong>absence of normative commitments and value-freedom</strong>,
and once more we contrast arguments in favor of such a conception with
the challenges it faces. The third conception of objectivity which we
discuss at length is the idea of <strong>absence of personal
bias</strong>. After discussing three case studies about objectivity
in scientific practice (from economics, social science and medicine)
as well as a radical alternative to the traditional conceptions of
objectivity, <strong>instrumentalism</strong>, we draw some
conclusions about what aspects of objectivity remain defensible and
desirable in the light of the difficulties we have discussed.</p>

<h2><a id="ObjFaiFac">2. Objectivity as Faithfulness to Facts</a></h2>

<p>The idea of this first conception of objectivity is that scientific
claims are objective in so far as they faithfully describe facts about
the world. The philosophical rationale underlying this conception of
objectivity is the view that there are facts &ldquo;out there&rdquo;
in the world and that it is the task of a scientist to discover, to
analyze and to systematize them. &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; then becomes
a success word: if a claim is objective, it successfully captures some
feature of the world.</p>

<p>In this view, science is objective to the degree that it succeeds
at discovering and generalizing facts, abstracting from the
perspective of the individual scientist. Although few philosophers
have fully endorsed such a conception of scientific objectivity, the
idea figures recurrently in the work of prominent 20<sup>th</sup>
century philosophers of science such as Carnap, Hempel, Popper, and
Reichenbach. It is also, in an evident way, related to the claims of
scientific realism, according to which it is the goal of science to
find out the truths about the world, and according to which we have
reason to believe in the truth of our best-confirmed scientific
theories.</p>

<h3><a id="VieNow">2.1 The View From Nowhere</a></h3>

<p>Humans experience the world from a perspective. The contents of an
individual's experiences vary greatly with the individual's
perspective, which is affected by his or her personal situation,
details of his or her perceptual apparatus, language and culture, the
physical conditions in which the perspective is made. While the
experiences vary, there seems to be something that remains
constant. The appearance of a tree will change as one approaches it
but, at least possibly, the tree itself doesn't. A room may feel hot
or cold depending on the climate one is used to but it will, at least
possibly, have a degree of warmth that is independent of one's
experiences. The object in front of a person does not, at least not
necessarily, disappear just because the lights are turned off.</p>

<p>There is a conception of objectivity that presupposes that there
are two kinds of qualities: ones that vary with the perspective one
has or takes, and ones that remain constant through changes of
perspective. The latter are the objective properties. Thomas Nagel
explains that we arrive at the idea of objective properties in three
steps (Nagel 1986: 14). The first step is to realize (or postulate)
that our perceptions are caused by the actions of things on us,
through their effects on our bodies. The second step is to realize (or
postulate) that since the same properties that cause perceptions in us
also have effects on other things and can exist without causing any
perceptions at all, their true nature must be detachable from their
perspectival appearance and need not resemble it. The final step is to
form a conception of that &ldquo;true nature&rdquo; independently of
any perspective. Nagel calls that conception the &ldquo;view from
nowhere&rdquo;, Bernard Williams the &ldquo;absolute conception&rdquo;
(Williams 1985 [2011]). It represents the world as it is, unmediated
by human minds and other &ldquo;distortions&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Many scientific realists maintain that science, or at least natural
science, does and indeed ought to aim to describe the world in terms
of this absolute conception and that it is to some extent successful
in doing so (for a detailed discussion of scientific realism, see
 the entry  on <a href="../scientific-realism/">scientific realism</a>). 
 There
is an immediate sense in which the absolute conception is an
attractive one to have. If two people looking at a colored patch in
front of them disagree whether it is green or brown, the absolute
conception provides an answer to the question (e.g., &ldquo;The patch
emits light at a wavelength of 510 nanometers&rdquo;). By making these
facts accessible through, say, a spectroscope, we can arbitrate
between the conflicting viewpoints (viz., by stating that the patch
should look green to a normal observer in daylight).</p>

<p>Another reason for this conception to be attractive is that it will
provide for a simpler and more unified representation of the
world. Theories of trees will be very hard to come by if they use
predicates such as &ldquo;height as seen by an observer&rdquo; and a
hodgepodge if their predicates track the habits of ordinary language
users rather than the properties of the world. To the extent, then,
that science aims to provide explanations for natural phenomena,
casting them in terms of the absolute conception would help to realize
this aim. Bernard Williams makes a related point about explanation:
</p>

<blockquote><p> The substance of the absolute conception (as
opposed to those vacuous or vanishing ideas of &ldquo;the world&rdquo;
that were offered before) lies in the idea that it could nonvacuously
explain how it itself, and the various perspectival views of the
world, are possible. (Williams 1985 [2011]: 139) </p></blockquote>

<p>
Thus, a scientific account cast in the language of the absolute
conception may not only be able to explain why a tree is as tall as it
is but also why we see it in one way when viewed from one standpoint
and in a different way when viewed from another.</p>

<p>A third reason to find the view from nowhere attractive is that if
the world came in structures as characterized by it and we did have
access to it, we could use our knowledge of it to ground predictions
(which, to the extent that our theories do track the absolute
structures, will be borne out). A fourth and related reason is that
attempts to manipulate and control phenomena can similarly be grounded
in our knowledge of these structures. To attain any of the four
purposes&mdash;settling disagreements, explaining the world,
predicting phenomena and manipulation and control&mdash;the absolute
conception is at best sufficient but not necessary. We can, for
instance, settle disagreements by imposing the rule that the person
who speaks first is always right or the person who is of higher social
rank or by an agreed-upon measurement procedure that does not track
absolute properties. We can explain the world and our image of it by
means of theories that do not represent absolute structures and
properties, and there is no need to get things (absolutely) right in
order to predict successfully. Nevertheless, there is something
appealing in the idea that disagreements concerning certain matters of
fact can be settled by the very facts themselves, that explanations
and predictions grounded in what's really there rather than in a
distorted image of it.</p>

<p>No matter how desirable, it is clear that our ability to use
scientific claims to represent all and only facts about the world
depends on whether these claims can unambiguously be established on
the basis of evidence. We test scientific claims by means of their
implications, and it is an elementary principle of logic that claims
whose implications are true need not themselves be true. It is the job
of scientific method to make sure that observations, measurements,
experiments, tests&mdash;pieces of the scientific
<em>evidence</em>&mdash;speak in favor of the scientific claim at
hand. Alas, the relation between evidence and scientific hypothesis is
not straightforward. <a href="#TheLadInc">Subsection 2.2</a> and
 <a href="#ExpReg">Subsection 2.3</a> will look at two challenges of the
idea that even the best scientific method will yield claims that
describe an aperspectival view from nowhere.
 <a href="#StaTheConEmpTruSci">Subsection 2.4</a> will challenge the idea
that the view from nowhere is a good thing to have.</p>

<h3><a id="TheLadInc">2.2 Theory-Ladenness and Incommensurability</a></h3>

<p>According to a popular picture, science progresses toward truth by
adding true and eliminating false beliefs from our best scientific
theories. By making these theories more and more verisimilar, that is,
truthlike, scientific knowledge grows over time (e.g., Popper
1963). If this picture is correct, then over time scientific knowledge
will become more objective, that is, more faithful to facts. However,
scientific theories often change, and sometimes several theories
compete for the place of the best scientific account of the world.</p>

<p>It is inherent in the above picture of scientific objectivity that
observations can, at least in principle, decide between competing
theories: if they did not, the conception of objectivity as
faithfulness would be a pointless one to have, as we would not be in a
position to verify it. This position has been adopted by Karl
R. Popper, Rudolf Carnap and other leading figures in (broadly)
empiricist philosophy of science. Many philosophers have argued that
the relation between observation and theory is way more complex and
that influences can actually run both ways (e.g., Duhem 1906 [1954];
Wittgenstein 1953 [2001]; Hanson 1958). The most lasting criticism,
however, was delivered by Thomas S. Kuhn (1962 [1970]) in his book
&ldquo;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Kuhn's analysis is built on the assumption that scientists always
view research problems through the lens of a paradigm, defined by set
of relevant problems, axioms, methodological presuppositions,
techniques, and so forth. Kuhn provided several historical examples in
favor of this claim. Scientific progress&mdash;and the practice of
normal, everyday science&mdash;happens within a paradigm that guides
the individual scientists' puzzle-solving work and that sets the
community standards.</p>

<p>Can observations undermine such a paradigm, and speak for a
different one? Here, Kuhn famously stresses that <strong>observations
are &ldquo;theory-laden&rdquo;</strong> (cf. also Hanson 1958): they
depend on a body of theoretical assumptions through which they are
perceived and conceptualized. This hypothesis has two important
aspects.</p>

<p>First, the <em>meaning</em> of observational concepts is influenced
by theoretical assumptions and presuppositions. For example, the
concepts &ldquo;mass&rdquo; and &ldquo;length&rdquo; have different
meanings in Newtonian and relativistic mechanics; so does the concept
&ldquo;temperature&rdquo; in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
(cf. Feyerabend 1962). In other words, Kuhn denies that there is a
theory-independent observation language. The &ldquo;faithfulness to
reality&rdquo; of an observation report is always mediated by a
theoretical <em>&Uuml;berbau</em>, disabling the role of observation
reports as an impartial, merely fact-dependent arbiter between
different theories.</p>

<p>Second, not only the observational concepts, but also the
<em>perception</em> of a scientist depends on the paradigm she is
working in.  </p>

<blockquote><p> Practicing in different worlds, the
two groups of scientists [who work in different paradigms, J.R./J.S.]
see different things when they look from the same point in the same
direction. (Kuhn 1962 [1970]: 150) </p></blockquote>

<p> That is, our
own sense data are shaped and structured by a theoretical framework,
and may be fundamentally distinct from the sense data of scientists
working in another one. Where a Ptolemaic astronomer like Tycho Brahe
sees a sun setting behind the horizon, a Copernican astronomer like
Johannes Kepler sees the horizon moving up to a stationary sun. If
this picture is correct, then it is hard to assess which theory or
paradigm is more faithful to the facts, that is, more objective.</p>

<p>The thesis of the theory-ladenness of observation has also been
extended to the <strong>incommensurability of different paradigms or
scientific theories</strong>, problematized independently by Thomas
S. Kuhn (1962 [1970]) and Paul Feyerabend (1962). Literally, this
concept means &ldquo;having no measure in common&rdquo;, and it
figures prominently in arguments against a linear and
standpoint-independent picture of scientific progress. For instance,
the Special Theory of Relativity appears to be more faithful to the
facts and therefore more objective than Newtonian mechanics because it
reduces, for low speeds, to the latter, and it accounts for some
additional facts that are not predicted correctly by Newtonian
mechanics. This picture is undermined, however, by two central aspects
of incommensurability. First, not only do the observational concepts
in both theories differ, but the principles for specifying their
meaning may be inconsistent with each other (Feyerabend 1975:
269&ndash;270). Second, scientific research methods and standards of
evaluation change with the theories or paradigms. Not all puzzles that
could be tackled in the old paradigm will be solved by the new
one&mdash;this is the phenomenon of &ldquo;Kuhn loss&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A meaningful use of objectivity presupposes, according to
Feyerabend, to perceive and to describe the world from a specific
perspective, e.g., when we try to verify the referential claims of a
scientific theory. Only <em>within</em> a peculiar scientific
worldview, the concept of objectivity may be applied
meaningfully. That is, scientific method cannot free itself from the
particular scientific theory to which it is applied; the door to
standpoint-independence is locked. As Feyerabend puts it:
</p>

<blockquote><p> our epistemic activities may have a decisive influence
even upon the most solid piece of cosmological furniture&mdash;they
make gods disappear and replace them by heaps of atom in empty
space. (1978: 70)</p></blockquote>

<p>Kuhn and Feyerabend's theses about theory-ladenness of observation,
and their implications for the objectivity of scientific inquiry have
been much debated afterwards, and have often been misunderstood in a
social constructivist sense. Therefore Kuhn later returned to the
topic of scientific objectivity, of which he gives his own
characterization in terms of the shared cognitive values of a
scientific community. We discuss Kuhn's later view in
 <a href="#EpiConVal">section 3.1</a>. For a more profound coverage, see

<h3><a id="ExpReg">2.3 The Experimenter's Regress</a></h3>

<p>Most of the earlier critics of &ldquo;objective&rdquo; verification
or falsification focused on the relation between evidence and
scientific theories. There is a sense in which the claim that this
relation is problematic is not so surprising. Scientific theories
contain highly abstract claims that describe states of affairs far
removed from the immediacy of sense experience. This is for a good
reason: sense experience is necessarily perspectival, so to the extent
to which scientific theories are to track the absolute conception,
they must describe a world different from that of sense
experience. But surely, one might think, the evidence itself is
objective. So even if we do have reasons to doubt that abstract
theories faithfully represent the world, we should stand on firmer
grounds when it comes to the evidence against which we test abstract
theories.</p>

<p>Theories are seldom tested against brute observations,
however. This too is for good reason: if they were, they'd be unlikely
to track the absolute conception. Simple generalizations such as
&ldquo;all swans are white&rdquo; are directly learned from
observations (say, of the color of swans) but they do not represent
the view from nowhere (for one thing, the view from nowhere doesn't
have colors). Genuine scientific theories are tested against
experimental facts or phenomena, which are themselves unobservable to
the unaided senses. Experimental facts or phenomena are instead
established using intricate procedures of scientific measurement and
experimentation.</p>

<p>We therefore need to ask whether the results of scientific
measurements and experiments can be aperspectival. In an important
debate in the 1980s and 1990s some commentators answered that question
with a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;, which was then rebutted by
others. The debate concerns the so-called &ldquo;experimenter's
regress&rdquo; (Collins 1985). Collins, a prominent sociologist of
science, claims that in order to know whether an experimental result
is correct, one first needs to know whether the apparatus producing
the result is reliable. But one doesn't know whether the apparatus is
reliable unless one knows that it produces correct results in the
first place and so on and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. Collins' main
case concerns attempts to detect gravitational waves, which were very
controversially discussed among physicists in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Collins argues that the circle is eventually broken not by the
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; themselves but rather by factors having to do with
the scientist's career, the social and cognitive interests of his
community, and the expected fruitfulness for future work. It is
important to note that in Collins's view these factors do not
necessarily make scientific results arbitrary. But what he does argue
is that the experimental results do not represent the world according
to the absolute conception. Rather, they are produced jointly by the
world, scientific apparatuses, and the psychological and sociological
factors mentioned above. The facts and phenomena of science are
therefore necessarily perspectival.</p>

<p>In a series of contributions, Allan Franklin, a
physicist-turned-philosopher of science, has tried to show that while
there are indeed no algorithmic procedures for establishing
experimental facts, disagreements can nevertheless be settled by
<em>reasoned judgement</em> on the basis of <em>bona fide</em>
epistemological criteria such as experimental checks and calibration,
elimination of possible sources of error, using apparatuses based on
well-corroborated theory and so on (Franklin 1994, 1997). Collins
responds that &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; is a social category that
is not drawn from physics (Collins 1994).</p>

<p>The main issue for us in this debate is whether there are any
reasons to believe that experimental results provide an aperspectival
view on the world. According to Collins, experimental results are
co-determined by the facts as well as social and psychological
factors. According to Franklin, whatever else influences experimental
results other than facts is not arbitrary but instead based on
reasoned judgment. What he has not shown is that reasoned judgment
guarantees that experimental results reflect the facts alone and are
therefore aperspectival in any interesting sense.</p>

<h3><a id="StaTheConEmpTruSci">2.4 Standpoint Theory, Contextual Empiricism and Trust in Science</a></h3>

<p>Feminist standpoint theorists and proponents of &ldquo;situated
knowledge&rdquo; such as Donna Haraway (1988), Sandra Harding (1991,
1993) and Alison Wylie (2003) deny the internal coherence of a view
from nowhere: all human knowledge is at base <em>human</em> knowledge
and is therefore necessarily perspectival. But they argue more than
that. Not only is perspectivality the human condition, it is also a
good thing to have. This is because perspectives, especially the
perspectives of underprivileged classes, come along with certain
epistemic advantages.</p>

<p>Standpoint theory is a development of certain Marxist ideas that
epistemic position is related to social position. According to this
view, workers, being members of an underprivileged class, have both
greater incentives to understand social relations better, and better
access to them because they live under the capitalists' rule and
therefore have access to the lives of capitalists as well as their own
lives. Feminist standpoint theory builds on these ideas but focuses on
gender, racial and other social relations.</p>

<p>These ideas are controversial but they draw attention to the
possibility that attempts to rid science of perspectives might not
only be futile because scientific knowledge is necessarily
perspectival, they can also be epistemically costly because they
prevent scientists from having the epistemic benefits certain
standpoints afford.</p>

<p>If there are no methods that guarantee objective outcomes or
objective criteria against which to assess outcomes, what might
&ldquo;procedural objectivity&rdquo; consist in? A particular answer
that goes back to Karl R. Popper (1972, 1934 [2002]) has been taken up
and modified by Helen Longino. Popper claimed that &ldquo;the
objectivity of scientific statements lies in the fact that they can be
inter-subjectively tested&rdquo; (1934 [2002]: 22), where
&ldquo;intersubjectively testable&rdquo; may be understood as there
being verifiable facts with evidential bearing on the theory in
question. So Popper does not see the objectivity of a scientific claim
in a direct correspondence to facts: rather, the claim must be
testable and subject to rational criticism.</p>

<p>Longino (1990) reinforces Popper's focus on intersubjective
criticism: for her, scientific knowledge is essentially a social
product. Thus, our conception of scientific objectivity must directly
engage with the social process that generates knowledge. In response
to the failures of attempts to define objectivity as faithfulness of
theory to facts, she concludes that social criticism fulfills crucial
functions in securing the epistemic success of science. The
objectivity of science is no more grounded in correspondence between
theory and facts, or in all scientists seeing the same result (called
&ldquo;concordant objectivity&rdquo; by Douglas 2011), but in the
&ldquo;interactive objectivity&rdquo; that emerges through the
scientists' open discourse. Specifically, she develops an epistemology
called <strong>contextual empiricism</strong> which regards a method
of inquiry as &ldquo;objective to the degree that it permits
<strong>transformative criticism</strong>&rdquo; (Longino 1990:
76). For an epistemic community to achieve transformative criticism,
there must be:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>avenues for criticism</strong>: criticism is an essential
part of scientific institutions (e.g., peer review);</li>

<li><strong>shared standards</strong>: the community must share a set
of cognitive values for assessing theories (more on this in
<a href="#EpiConVal">section 3.1</a>);</li>

<li><strong>uptake of criticism</strong>: criticism must be able to
transform scientific practice in the long run;</li>

<li><strong>equality of intellectual authority</strong>: intellectual
authority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Longino's contextual empiricism can be understood as a development
of John Stuart Mill's view that beliefs should never be suppressed,
independently of whether they are true or false (Mill 1859
[2003]). Even the most implausible beliefs might, for all we know, be
true as we are not infallible; and if they are false, they might
contain a grain of truth which is worth preserving or, if wholly
false, help to better articulate and defend those beliefs which are
true (Mill 1859 [2003]: 72).</p>

<p>Social epistemologists such as Longino similarly see objectivity
neither in the products of science (as there is no view from nowhere)
nor in its methods (as there aren't any standards that are valid
independently of the contexts of specific inquiries) but rather in the
idea that many and competing voices are heard. The underlying
intuition is supported by recent empirical research on the epistemic
benefits of a diversity of opinions and perspectives (Page 2007).</p>

<p>The turn from scientific results and methods to the social
organization of science involves numerous problems. On the one hand,
we might ask how many and which voices must be heard for science to be
objective. It is not clear for instance whether non-scientists should
have as much authority as trained scientists. The condition of
equality of intellectual requires only &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;
practitioners to equally share authority&mdash;but who qualifies as
&ldquo;qualified&rdquo;? Nor is it clear whether it is always a good
idea to subject every scientific result to democratic approval, as
Paul Feyerabend proposed (Feyerabend 1975: 1978). There is no
guarantee that democratized science leads to true theories, or even
reliable ones. So why should we value objectivity in the sense of
social epistemologists?</p>

<p>One answer to this question has been given by Arthur Fine who
argues that we value objectivity in this sense because it promotes
trust in science (Fine 1998: 17). While there is no guarantee that the
process leads to true theories, it is nevertheless trusted because it
is fair. We will consider Fine's views on objectivity in more detail
below in <a href="#InsRes">section 6</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="ObjAbsNorComValFreIde">3. Objectivity as Absence of Normative Commitments and the Value-Free Ideal</a></h2>

<p>The previous section has presented us with forceful arguments
against the view of objectivity as faithfulness to facts and an
impersonal &ldquo;view from nowhere&rdquo;. How can we maintain the
view that objectivity is one of the essential features of
science&mdash;and the one that grounds its epistemic authority? A
popular reply contends that science should be
<strong>value-free</strong> and that scientific claims or practices
are objective to the extent that they are free of moral, political and
social values.</p>

<h3><a id="EpiConVal">3.1 Epistemic and Contextual Values</a></h3>

<p>Before addressing what we will call the &ldquo;value-free
ideal&rdquo;, it will be helpful to distinguish four stages at which
values may affect science. They are: (i) the choice of a scientific
research problem; (ii) the gathering of evidence in relation to the
problem; (iii) the acceptance of a scientific hypothesis or theory as
an adequate answer to the problem on the basis of the evidence; (iv)
the proliferation and application of scientific research results
(Weber 1917 [1988]).</p>

<p>Most philosophers of science would agree that the role of values in
science is contentious only with respect to dimensions (ii) and (iii):
the <strong>gathering of evidence</strong> and the <strong>acceptance
of scientific theories</strong>. It is almost universally accepted
that the choice of a research problem is often influenced by the
interests of individual scientists, funding parties, and society as a
whole. This influence may make science more shallow and slow down its
long-run progress, but it has benefits, too: scientists will focus on
providing solutions to those intellectual problems that are considered
urgent by society and they may actually improve people's
lives. Similarly, the proliferation and application of scientific
research results is evidently affected by the personal values of
journal editors and end users, and there seems to be little one can do
about this. The real debate is about whether or not the
&ldquo;core&rdquo; of scientific reasoning&mdash;the gathering of
evidence and the assessment and acceptance scientific
theories&mdash;is, and should be, value-free.</p>

<p>An obvious, but ultimately unconvincing criticism of the value-free
ideal invokes the &ldquo;underdetermination of theory by
evidence&rdquo; (see the entry on 
 <a href="../scientific-underdetermination/">underdetermination of scientific theory</a>).
 As we have seen
above, the relationship between theory and evidence is rather
complex. More often than not in the history of science, the existing
body of evidence in some domain does not pick out a unique theoretical
account of that domain. &ldquo;Crucial experiments&rdquo; do not
refute a specific scientific claim, but only indicate that there is an
error in an entire network of hypotheses (Duhem 1906 [1954]). Thus,
existing bodies of evidence often <em>underdetermine</em> the choice
of rival theoretical accounts.</p>

<p>According to the critics of the value-free ideal, the gap between
evidence and theory must be filled in by <strong>scientific
values</strong>. Consider a classical curve-fitting problem. When
fitting a curve to a data set, the researcher often has the choice
between either using a higher-order polynomial, which makes the curve
less <em>simple</em> but fits the data more <em>accurately</em>, or
using a lower-order polynomial, which makes the curve <em>simpler</em>
albeit less <em>accurate</em>. Simplicity and accuracy are both
scientific values: for instance, econometricians have a preference for
solving curve-fitting problems by means of linear regression, thereby
valuing simplicity over accuracy (though see Forster and Sober 1994
for a competing account of this practice).</p>

<p>Philosophers of science however tend to regard value-ladenness in
this sense as benign. <strong>Epistemic (or cognitive) values</strong>
such as predictive accuracy, scope, unification, explanatory power,
simplicity and coherence with other accepted theories are taken to be
indicative of a good scientific theory and figure in standard
arguments for preferring one theory over another. Kuhn (1977) even
claims that epistemic values define the shared commitments of science,
that is, the standards of theory assessment that characterize the
scientific approach as a whole.</p>

<p>A word on terminology. Sometimes epistemic values are regarded as a
subset of cognitive values and identified with values such as
empirical adequacy and internal consistency that directly bear on the
veracity of a scientific theory (Laudan 2004). Values such as scope
and explanatory power would then count as cognitive values that
express scientific desiderata, but without properly epistemic
implications. We have decided, however, to adopt a broader reading of
&ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; where truth is not the only aim of scientific
inquiry, but supplemented by providing causal mechanisms, finding
natural laws, creating understanding, etc. In this sense, values such
as scope or explanatory power contribute to achieving our epistemic
goals. Neat distinctions between strictly truth-conducive and purely
cognitive scientific values are hard to come by (see Douglas 2013 for
a classification attempt).</p>

<p>Not every philosopher entertains the same list of epistemic
values. In Lycan's (1985) pragmatic perspective, simplicity is
included because it reduces the cognitive workload of the scientific
practitioner, and because it facilitates the use of scientific
theories in dealing with real-world problems. McMullin (2009), on the
other hand, does not include simplicity because the notion is
ambiguous, and because there are no conclusive arguments that simpler
theories are more likely to be true, or empirically
adequate. Subjective differences in ranking and applying epistemic
values do not vanish, a point Kuhn made emphatically. This is also one
of the reasons for using the term &ldquo;value&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;rule&rdquo;: the assessment of a scientific theory rather
corresponds to a <em>judgment</em> where different criteria are
carefully weighed than to the mechanic application of a rule or
algorithm to determine the best theory (McMullin 1982: 17).</p>

<p>In most views, the objectivity and authority of science is not
threatened by epistemic, but only by <strong>contextual
(non-cognitive) values</strong>. Contextual values are moral,
personal, social, political and cultural values such as pleasure,
justice and equality, conservation of the natural environment and
diversity. The most notorious cases of improper uses of such values
involve travesties of scientific reasoning, where the intrusion of
contextual values led to an intolerant and oppressive scientific
agenda with devastating epistemic and social consequences. In the
Third Reich, a large part of contemporary physics, such as the theory
of relativity, was condemned because its inventors were Jewish; in the
Soviet Union, biologist Nikolai Vavilov was sentenced to death (and
died in prison) because his theories of genetic inheritance did not
match Marxist-Leninist ideology. Both states tried to foster a science
that was motivated by political convictions (Lenard's &ldquo;Deutsche
Physik&rdquo; in Nazi Germany, Lysenko's anti-genetic theory of
inheritance in the Soviet Union), leading to disastrous epistemic and
institutional effects.</p>

<p>Less spectacular but numerically more significant cases analyzed by
feminist philosophers of science involve gender or racial bias in
biological theories (e.g., Okruhlik 1994; Lloyd 2005). Moreover, a lot
of industry-sponsored research in medicine (and elsewhere) is
demonstrably biased toward the interests of the sponsors, usually
large pharmaceutic firms (e.g., Resnik 2007; Reiss 2010). This
<strong>preference bias</strong>, defined by Wilholt (2009) as the
infringement of conventional standards of the research community, with
the aim of arriving at a particular result, is clearly epistemically
harmful. Especially for sensitive high-stakes issues such as the
admission of medical drugs or the consequences of anthropogenic global
warming, it seems desirable that research scientists assess theories
without being influenced by such considerations. This is the core idea
of the</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Value-Free Ideal (VFI):</strong> Scientists should strive
to minimize the influence of contextual values on scientific
reasoning, e.g., in gathering evidence and assessing/accepting
scientific theories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the VFI, scientific objectivity is characterized by
absence of contextual values and by exclusive commitment to epistemic
values in scientific reasoning. See Dorato (2004: 53&ndash;54), Ruphy
(2006: 190) or Biddle (2013: 125) for alternative formulations.</p>

<p>The next question is then whether the VFI is actually
attainable. This is the subject of the</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Value-Neutrality Thesis (VNT):</strong> Scientists
can&mdash;at least in principle&mdash;gather evidence and
assess/accept theories without making contextual value judgments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this latter thesis is defended less frequently than the VFI,
it serves as a useful foil for discussing its attainability. Note that
the VNT is not normative: it only investigates whether the judgments
that scientists make are, or could possibly be, free of contextual
values.</p>

<p>The VNT is denied by the value-laden thesis, which asserts that
contextual values are essential for scientific research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Value-Laden Thesis (VLT):</strong> Scientists cannot gather
evidence and assess/accept theories without making contextual value
judgments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter thesis is sometimes strengthened to the claim that both
epistemic and contextual values are essential to scientific
research&mdash;and pursuit of a science without contextual values
would be harmful both epistemically and socially 
(<a href="#FeyTyrRatMet">see section 3.4</a>). Either way, the acceptance
of the value-laden thesis poses a challenge for re-defining scientific
objectivity: one can either conclude that the ideal of objectivity is
harmful and should be rejected (as Feyerabend does), or one can come
up with a different and refined conception of objectivity (as Douglas
and Longino do).</p>

<p>This section discusses the VNT as applied to the assessment and
acceptance of scientific hypothesis, the role of the VFI at the
interface between scientific reasoning and policy advice, and Paul
Feyerabend's radical attack on the VNT.</p>

<h3><a id="AccSciHypValNeu">3.2 Acceptance of Scientific Hypotheses and Value Neutrality</a></h3>

<p>Regarding the assessment of scientific theories, the VNT is a
relatively recent position in philosophy of science. Its rise is
closely connected to Reichenbach's famous distinction between
<strong>context of discovery</strong> and <strong>context of
justification</strong>. Reichenbach first made this distinction with
respect to the epistemology of mathematics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the objective relation from the given entities to the solution, and
the subjective way of finding it, are clearly separated for problems
of a deductive character [&hellip;] we must learn to make the same
distinction for the problem of the inductive relation from facts to
theories. (Reichenbach 1938: 36&ndash;37)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard interpretation of this statement marks contextual
values, which may have contributed to the discovery of a theory, as
irrelevant for <em>justifying</em> the acceptance of a theory, and for
assessing how evidence bears on theory&mdash;the relation that is
crucial for the objectivity of science. Contextual values are
restricted to a matter of individual psychology that may influence the
discovery, development and proliferation of a scientific theory, but
not its epistemic status.</p>

<p>This distinction played a crucial role in post-World War II
philosophy of science. It presupposes, however, a clear-cut
distinction between epistemic values on the one hand and contextual
values on the other. While this may be <em>prima facie</em> plausible
for disciplines such as physics, there is an abundance of contextual
values in the social sciences, for instance, in the conceptualization
and measurement of a nation's wealth, or in different ways to measure
the inflation rate (cf. Dupr&eacute; 2007; Reiss 2008). More generally, three
major lines of criticism can be identified.</p>

<p>First, Helen Longino (1996) has argued that traditional
&ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; values such as consistency, simplicity,
breadth of scope and fruitfulness are not purely epistemic after all,
and that their use imports political and social values into contexts
of scientific judgment. According to her, the use of epistemic values
in scientific judgments is not always, not even normally, politically
neutral. She proposes to juxtapose these values with feminist values
such as novelty, ontological heterogeneity, mutuality of interaction,
applicability to human needs and diffusion of power, and argues that
the use of the traditional value instead of its alternative (e.g.,
simplicity instead of ontological heterogeneity) can lead to biases
and adverse research results. Longino's argument here is different
from the one discussed in <a href="#EpiConVal">section 3.1</a>. It
casts the very distinction between epistemic and contextual values
into doubt.</p>

<p>The use of language in descriptions of scientific hypotheses and
results poses a second challenge to VNT. As Hilary Putnam has recently
argued, fact and value are frequently entangled because of the use of
so-called &ldquo;thick&rdquo; ethical concepts in scientific
descriptions (Putnam 2002). Consider Putnam's own example, the word
&ldquo;cruel&rdquo;. The statement &ldquo;Susan is a cruel
teacher&rdquo; entails certain statements about Susan's behavior
towards her pupils, perhaps that she gives unnecessarily low grades,
puts them on the spot, pokes fun at them or slaps them. It has
<em>descriptive</em> content. But it also expresses our moral
disapproval of Susan's behavior. To call someone cruel is to reprehend
him or her. The term has therefore also <em>normative</em>
content. Thick ethical terms are terms that, like cruel, have a mixed
descriptive and normative content. They contrast with
&ldquo;thin&rdquo; ethical terms that are purely normative:
&ldquo;good&rdquo;/&#8203;&ldquo;bad&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;/&#8203;&ldquo;must not&rdquo;,
&ldquo;right&rdquo;/&#8203;&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>Putnam argues at some length that (a) the normative content of
thick ethical terms is ineliminable; and (b) thick ethical concepts
cannot be factored into descriptive and normative components. Neither
of these arguments would, if successful, necessarily cause concern for
a defender of the VNT. The existence of terms in which facts and
values are inextricably entangled does not pose a threat to scientists
who wish to describe their hypotheses and results in a value-free
manner: they could simply avoid using thick ethical terms. The crucial
question is therefore whether or not scientific hypotheses and the
description of results necessarily involves such terms.</p>

<p>John Dupr&eacute; has argued that thick ethical terms are ineliminable
from science, at least certain parts of it (Dupr&eacute; 2007). Dupr&eacute;'s point
is essentially that scientific hypotheses and results concern us
because they are relevant to human interests, and thus they will
necessarily be couched in a language that uses thick ethical
terms. While it will often be possible to translate ethically thick
descriptions into neutral ones, the translation cannot be made without
losses, and these losses obtain precisely because human interests are
involved. According to Dupr&eacute;, then, there are many scientific
statements that are value-free but they are value-free because their
truth or falsity does not matter to us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether electrons have a positive or a negative charge and whether
there is a black hole in the middle of our galaxy are questions of
absolutely no immediate importance to us. The only human interests
they touch (and these they may indeed touch deeply) are cognitive
ones, and so the only values that they implicate are cognitive values.
(2007: 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A third challenge to VNT was posed by Richard Rudner in his
influential article &ldquo;The Scientist Qua Scientist Makes Value
Judgments&rdquo; (Rudner 1953). Rudner disputes the core of the VNT
and the context of discovery/justification distinction: the idea that
the acceptance of a scientific theory can in principle be
value-free. We now discuss Rudner's argument in some detail.</p>

<p>First, Rudner argues that </p>

<blockquote><p> no analysis of what
constitutes the method of science would be satisfactory unless it
comprised some assertion to the effect that the scientist as scientist
<strong>accepts or rejects hypotheses</strong>. (1953: 2)
</p></blockquote>

<p> This assumption stems from the practice of industrial quality
control and other application-oriented research. In such contexts, it
is often necessary to accept or to reject a hypothesis (e.g., the
efficacy of a drug) in order to make effective decisions.</p>

<p>Second, he notes that no scientific hypothesis is ever confirmed
beyond reasonable doubt&mdash;some probability of error always
remains. When we accept or reject a hypothesis, there is always a
chance that our decision is mistaken. Hence, our decision is also
&ldquo;a function of the <em>importance</em>, in the typically ethical
sense, of making a mistake in accepting or rejecting a
hypothesis&rdquo; (1953: 2): we are balancing the seriousness of two
possible errors (erroneous acceptance/rejection of the hypothesis)
against each other. This corresponds to type I and type II error in
statistical inference.</p>

<p>Hence, ethical judgments and contextual values enter the
scientist's core activity of accepting and rejecting hypotheses, and
the VNT stands refuted. Closely related arguments can be found in
Churchman (1948) and Braithwaite (1953). Hempel (1965: 91&ndash;92)
gives a modified account of Rudner's argument by distinguishing
between judgments of <em>confirmation</em>, which are free of
contextual values, and judgments of <em>acceptance</em>. Since even
strongly confirming evidence cannot fully prove a universal scientific
law, we have to live with a residual &ldquo;inductive risk&rdquo; in
inferring that law. Contextual values influence scientific methods by
determining the acceptable amount of inductive risk.</p>

<p>But how general are Rudner's findings? Apparently, the result holds
true of <strong>applied science</strong>, but not necessarily of
<strong>fundamental research</strong>. For instance, Richard Jeffrey
(1956) notes that lawlike hypotheses in theoretical science (e.g., the
gravitational law in Newtonian mechanics) are characterized by their
general scope and not confined to a particular application. Obviously,
a scientist cannot fine-tune her decisions to their possible
consequences in a wide variety of different contexts. So she should
just refrain at all from the essentially pragmatic decision to accept
or reject a hypothesis and restrict herself to gathering and
interpreting the evidence. This objection was foreshadowed by the
statistician, methodologist and geneticist Ronald A. Fisher:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>in the field of pure research</em> no assessment of the cost of
wrong conclusions [&hellip;] can conceivably be more than a pretence,
and in any case such an assessment would be inadmissible and
irrelevant in judging the state of the scientific evidence. (Fisher
1935: 25&ndash;26, our emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By restricting scientific reasoning to gathering and interpreting
evidence, possibly supplemented by assessing the probability of a
hypothesis, and abandoning the business of accepting/rejecting
hypotheses, Jeffrey tries to save the VNT in fundamental scientific
research, and the objectivity of scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>A related attempt to save the VNT is given by Isaac Levi
(1960). Levi observes that scientists commit themselves to certain
standards of inference when they become a member of the
profession. This may, for example, lead to the statistical rejection
of a hypothesis when the observed significance level is smaller than
5%. These community standards may eliminate any room for contextual
ethical judgment on behalf of the scientist: they determine when
he/she should accept a hypothesis as established. Value judgments may
be implicit in the standards of scientific inference, but not in the
daily work of an <em>individual</em> scientist. Such conventional
standards are especially prolific in theoretical research where it
does not make sense to specify application-oriented utilities of
accepting or rejecting a hypothesis (cf. Wilholt 2013). The VNT, and
the idea of scientific objectivity as value freedom, could then be
saved for the case of individual scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>Both defenses of the VNT focus on the impact of values in theory
choice, either by denying that scientists actually choose theories
(Jeffrey), or by referring to community standards (Levi). Douglas
(2000: 563&ndash;565) points out, however, that the
&ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; of scientific theories is only one of several
places for values to enter scientific reasoning, albeit an especially
prominent and explicit one. Many decisions in the process of
scientific inquiry may conceal implicit value judgments: the design of
an experiment, the methodology for conducting it, the characterization
of the data, the choice of a statistical method for processing and
analyzing data, the interpretational process findings, etc. None of
these methodological decisions could be made without consideration of
the possible consequences that could occur. Douglas gives, as a case
study, a series of experiments where carcinogenic effects of dioxin
exposure on rats were probed. Contextual values such as safety and
risk aversion affected the conducted research at various stages:
first, in the classification of pathological samples as benign or
cancerous (over which a lot of expert disagreement occurred), second,
in the extrapolation from the high-dose experimental conditions to the
more realistic low-dose conditions. In both cases, the choice of a
conservative classification or model had to be weighed against the
adverse consequences for society that could result from
underestimating the risks (cf. Biddle 2013).</p>

<p>These diagnoses cast a gloomy light on attempts to divide
scientific labor between gathering evidence and determining the degree
of confirmation (value-free) and accepting scientific theories
(value-laden). The entire process of conceptualizing, gathering and
interpreting evidence is so entangled with contextual values that no
neat division, as Jeffrey envisions, will work outside the narrow
realm of statistical inference&mdash;and even there, doubts may be
raised (<a href="#IndStaInf">see section 4.2</a>).</p>

<p>Philip Kitcher (2011a: 31&ndash;40) gives an alternative argument,
based on his idea of &ldquo;significant truths&rdquo;. According to
Kitcher, even staunch scientific realists will not hold that science
aims at truth as a goal in itself. There are simply too many truths
that are of no interest whatsoever&mdash;consider all the truths about
the areas of triangles whose vertices are three arbitrarily chosen
objects (2011a: 106). Science, then, doesn't aim at truth
<em>simpliciter</em> but rather at something more narrow: truth worth
pursuing from the point of view of our cognitive, practical and social
goals. Any truth that is worth pursuing in this sense is what he calls
a &ldquo;significant truth&rdquo;. Clearly, it is value judgments that
help us decide whether or not any given truth is significant.</p>

<p>What Kitcher argues so far is consistent with the traditional view
according to which values enter mainly at the first stage of
scientific investigation, problem selection. But then he goes on to
observe that the process of scientific investigation cannot neatly be
divided into a stage in which the research question is chosen, one in
which the evidence is gathered and one in which a judgment about the
question is made on the basis of the evidence.</p>

<p>Rather, the sequence is multiply iterated. At each stage, the
researcher has to decide whether previous results warrant further
investigation in the same line of research or whether it would be more
fruitful to switch to another avenue, even if the overall goal remains
constant. These choices are laden with contextual values.</p>

<p>To add some precision to this idea, Kitcher distinguishes
<strong>three schemes of values</strong>: a broad scheme, a cognitive
scheme and a probative scheme. The broad scheme of values is the set
of commitments around which someone's life is organized, including
personal ideals and goals and those people have for the societies in
which they live. The cognitive scheme of values concerns the kinds of
knowledge a person values, for their own sake or for the sake of their
practical consequences. The probative scheme of values, lastly,
concerns more specific questions a researcher finds worth
pursuing.</p>

<p>Kitcher now argues that the three schemes mutually interact. Thus,
the cognitive scheme might change in response to pressures from the
probative and the broad scheme. We give an example of our own. Assume
that the cognitive scheme endorses predictive success as an important
goal of science. However, the probative scheme finds no available or
conceivable strategy to reach this goal in some domain of science, for
instance because that domain is characterized by strong non-linear
dependencies. In this case, predictive success might have to yield to
other forms of scientific knowledge. After all, we would be irrational
if we continued to pursue a goal that is unattainable in
principle. Conversely, changes in the broad scheme will often
necessitate adjustments in the cognitive and probative schemes:
changing social goals lead to revaluations of scientific knowledge and
research methods.</p>

<p>Science, then, cannot be value-free because no scientist ever works
exclusively in the supposedly value-free zone of assessing and
accepting hypotheses. Evidence is gathered and hypotheses are assessed
and accepted in the light of their potential for application and
fruitful research avenues. Both epistemic and contextual value
judgments guide these choices and are themselves influenced by their
results. More than that, to portray science as value-free enterprise
carries a danger with it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deepest source of the current erosion of scientific authority
consists in insisting on the value-freedom of Genuine
Science&hellip;</p> (Kitcher 2011a: 40)</blockquote>

<h3><a id="SciPolValFreIde">3.3 Science, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal</a></h3>

<p>While the previous discussion focused on the VNT, and the practical
attainability of the VFI, little has been said about whether value
freedom is desirable in the first place. This subsection discusses
this topic with special attention to informing and advising public
policy from a scientific perspective. While the VFI, and many
arguments for and against it, can be applied to science as a whole,
the interface of science and public policy is the place where the
intrusion of values into science is especially salient, and where it
is surrounded by the greatest controversy. Quite recently, the
discovery that climate scientists were pursuing a particular
socio-political agenda (the &ldquo;Climategate&rdquo; affair) did much
to damage the authority of science in the public arena.</p>

<p>Indeed, many debates at the interface of science and public policy
are characterized by disagreements on propositions that combine a
factual basis with specific goals and values. Take, for instance, the
view that growing transgenic crops carries too much risk in terms of
biosecurity, or that global warming needs to be addressed by cutting
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The critical question in such debates is
whether there are theses <i>T</i> such that one side in the debate
endorses <i>T</i>, the other side rejects it, the evidence is shared,
and both sides have good reasons for their respective positions.</p>

<p>According to the VFI, scientists should uncover an epistemic,
value-free basis for resolving such disagreements and restrict the
dissent to the realm of value judgments. Even if the VNT should turn
out to be untenable, and a strict separation to be impossible, the VFI
may have an important function for <em>guiding</em> scientific
research and for minimizing the impact of values on an objective
science. In the philosophy of science, one camp of scholars defends
the VFI as a necessary antidote to individual and institutional
interests, like Hugh Lacey (1999, 2002), Ernan McMullin (1982) and
Sandra Mitchell (2004), while others adopt a critical attitude, like
Helen Longino (1990, 1996), Philip Kitcher (2011a) or Heather Douglas
(2009). These criticisms may refer to the desirability, attainability
or the conceptual (un)clarity of the VFI. We begin with defenses of
the VFI.</p>

<p>Lacey distinguishes three components or interpretations of the VFI:
impartiality, neutrality and autonomy. <strong>Impartiality</strong>
implies that theories are solely accepted or appraised in virtue of
their contribution to the epistemic values of science, such as truth,
accuracy or explanatory power. In particular, the choice of theories
is not influenced by contextual values. <strong>Neutrality</strong>
means that scientific theories make no value statements about the
world: they are concerned with what there is, not with what there
should be. Finally, scientific <strong>autonomy</strong> means that
the scientific agenda is shaped by the desire to increase scientific
knowledge, and that contextual values have no place in scientific
method.</p>

<p>These three interpretations of the VFI can be combined with each
other, or used individually. All of them, however, are subject to
criticisms. First, at a descriptive level, it is clear that autonomy
of science often fails in practice due to the presence of external
interests, e.g., funding agencies and industry lobbies. Neutrality is
questionable in the light of the implicit role of values in social
science, e.g., in Rational Choice Theory
 (<a href="#ConRatChoThe">see section 5.2</a>). Impartiality has
 been criticized in the above
discussion of the VNT.</p>

<p>Second, it has been argued that the VFI is not desirable at
all. Feminist philosophers (e.g., Harding 1991; Okruhlik 1994; Lloyd
2005) have argued that science often carries a heavy androcentric
values, for instance in biological theories about sex, gender and
rape. The charge against these values is not so much that they are
contextual rather than epistemic, but that they are unjustified. The
explicit consideration of feminist values may act as a helpful
antidote, in stark contrast with the VFI. Moreover, if scientists did
follow the VFI rigidly, policy-makers would pay even less attention to
them, with a detrimental effect on the decisions they take (Cranor
1993). Given these shortcomings, the VFI has to be rethought if it is
supposed to play a useful role for guiding scientific research and
leading to better policy decisions.</p>

<p>Douglas (2009: 7&ndash;8) proposes that the epistemic authority of
science can be detached from its autonomy by distinguishing between
<strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect roles for values in
science</strong>. The assessment of evidence may legitimately be
affected indirectly by contextual values: they may determine how we
interpret noisy datasets, what is the appropriate standard of evidence
for a specific claim, how the severity of consequences of a decision
must be assessed, and so on. This concerns, above all, policy-related
disciplines such as climate science or economics that routinely
perform scientific risk analyses for real-world problems (cf. also
Shrader-Frechette 1991). What must not happen, however, is that
contextual values trump scientific evidence, or are used as a reason
to ignore evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cognitive, ethical and social values all have legitimate, indirect
roles to play in the doing of science [&hellip;]. When these values
play a direct role in the heart of science, problems arise as
unacceptable reasoning occurs and the reason for valuing science is
undermined. (Douglas 2009: 108)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Douglas's conception of objectivity emphasizes a prohibition for
values to replace or dismiss scientific evidence&mdash;she calls this
<strong>detached objectivity</strong>&mdash;but it is complemented by
various other aspects that relate to a reflective balancing of various
perspectives and the procedural, social aspects of science
(ch. 6). Instead of subscribing to the traditional VFI, Douglas
suggests to rescue scientific integrity and objectivity by
&ldquo;keeping values to their proper roles&rdquo; (2009: 175).</p>

<p>That said, Douglas' proposal is not very concrete when it comes to
implementation, e.g., regarding the way diverse values should be
balanced. Compromising in the middle cannot be the solution (Weber
1917 [1988]). First, no standpoint is, just in virtue of being in the
middle, evidentially supported vis-&agrave;-vis more extreme
positions. Second, these middle positions are also, from a practical
point of view, the least functional when it comes to advising
policy-makers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the distinction between direct and indirect roles of
values in science may not be sufficiently clear-cut to police the
legitimate use of values in science. Douglas (2009: 96) distinguishes
between values as &ldquo;reasons in themselves&rdquo;, that is,
treating them as evidence or defeaters for evidence (direct role,
illegitimate) and as &ldquo;helping to decide what should count as a
<em>sufficient</em> reason for a choice&rdquo; (indirect role,
legitimate). But can we always draw a neat borderline? Assume that a
scientist considers, for whatever reason, the consequences of
erroneously accepting hypothesis <i>H</i> undesirable. Therefore he
uses a statistical model whose results are likely to favor
&not;<i>H</i> over <i>H</i>. Is this a matter of reasonable
conservativeness? Or doesn't it amount to reasoning to a foregone
conclusion, and to treating values as evidence (cf. Elliott 2011:
320&ndash;321)?</p>

<p>The most recent literature on values and evidence in science
presents us with a broad spectrum of opinions. Steele (2012) bolsters
Douglas's approach by arguing that various probabilistic assessments
of uncertainty, e.g., imprecise probability, involve contextual value
judgments as well. Betz (2013) argues, by contrast, that scientists
can largely avoid making contextual value judgments if they carefully
express the uncertainty involved with their evidential judgments,
e.g., by using a scale ranging from purely qualitative evidence (such
as expert judgment) to precise probabilistic assessments. The issue of
value judgments at earlier stages of inquiry is not addressed by this
proposal; however, disentangling evidential judgments and judgments
involving contextual values at the stage of theory assessment may be a
good thing in itself.</p>

<p>Thus, should we or should we not worried about values in scientific
reasoning? While Douglas and others make a convincing case that the
interplay of values and evidential considerations need not be
pernicious, it is unclear why it <em>adds</em> to the success or the
authority of science. After all, the values of an individual scientist
who makes a risk assessment, need not agree with those of society. How
are we going to ensure that the permissive attitude towards values in
setting evidential standards etc. is not abused? In the absence of a
general theory about which contextual values are beneficial and which
are pernicious, can't we defend the VFI as a first-order approximation
to a sound, transparent and objective science? Science seems to
require <em>some</em> independence from contextual values in order to
maintain its epistemic authority.</p>

<h3><a id="FeyTyrRatMet">3.4 Feyerabend: The Tyranny of the Rational Method</a></h3>

<p>This section looks at Paul Feyerabend's radical assault on the
rationality and objectivity of scientific method (see also the entry
on 
 <a href="../feyerabend/">Feyerabend</a>). His position is
exceptional in the philosophical literature since traditionally, the
threat for objectivity is located in contextual rather than epistemic
values. Feyerabend turns this view upside down: it is the
&ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; of rational method, and the emphasis on
epistemic rather than contextual values that prevents us from having a
science in the service of society. Thus, Feyerabend vociferously
denies the VFI and also the VNT by his claim that Western science is
loaded with all kinds of pernicious values.</p>

<p>Feyerabend's writings on objectivity and values in science have an
epistemic as well as a political dimension. Regarding the first, the
leading philosophy of science figures in Feyerabend's young days such
as Carnap, Hempel and Popper characterized scientific method in terms
of rules for rational scientific reasoning. Some of them, like Popper,
devoted special attention to the demarcation of science from
&ldquo;pseudo-science&rdquo; and imposture, thereby derogating other
traditions as irrational or, in any case, inferior. Feyerabend thinks,
however, that science must be protected from a &ldquo;rule of
rationality&rdquo;, identified with strict adherence to scientific
method: such rules only suppress an open exchange of ideas, extinguish
scientific creativity and prevent a free and truly democratic
science.</p>

<p>In his classic &ldquo;Against Method&rdquo; (1975:
chs. 8&ndash;13), Feyerabend elaborates on this criticism by examining
a famous episode in the history of science: the development of
Galilean mechanics and the discovery of the Jupiter moons. In
superficial treatments of this episode, it is stressed that an
obscurantist and value-driven Catholic Church forced Galilei to recant
from a scientifically superior position backed by value-free,
objective findings. But in fact, Feyerabend argues, the Church had the
better arguments by the standards of 17th century science. Their
conservatism regarding their <em>Weltanschauung</em> was
scientifically backed: Galilei's telescopes were unreliable for
celestial observations, and many well-established phenomena (no fixed
star parallax, invariance of laws of motion) could at first not be
explained in the heliocentric system. Hence, scientific method was not
on Galilei's side, but on the side of the Church who gave preference
to the old, Ptolemaic worldview. With hindsight, Galilei managed to
achieve groundbreaking scientific progress just because he
deliberately violated rules of scientific reasoning, because he
stubbornly stuck to a problematic approach until decisive theoretical
and technological innovations were made. Hence Feyerabend's dictum
&ldquo;Anything goes&rdquo;: no methodology whatsoever is able to
capture the creative and often irrational ways by which science
deepens our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>The drawbacks of an objective, value-free and method-bound view on
science and scientific method are not only epistemic. Such a view
narrows down our perspective and makes us less free, open-minded,
creative, and ultimately, less human in our thinking (Feyerabend 1975:
154). It is therefore neither possible nor desirable to have an
objective, value-free science (cf. Feyerabend 1978: 78&ndash;79). As a
consequence, Feyerabend sees traditional forms of inquiry about our
world (e.g., Chinese medicine) on a par with their Western
competitors. He denounces appeals to objective standards as barely
disguised statements of preference for one's own worldview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is hardly any difference between the members of a
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; tribe who defend their laws because they are
the laws of the gods [&hellip;] and a rationalist who appeals to
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; standards, except that the former know what
they are doing while the latter does not. (1978: 82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the defenders of scientific method abuse the word
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; for proving the superiority of Western science
vis-&agrave;-vis other worldviews. To this, Feyerabend adds that when
dismissing other traditions, we actually project our own worldview,
and our own value judgments, into them instead of making an impartial
comparison (1978: 80&ndash;83). There is no purely rational
justification for dismissing other perspectives in favor of the
Western scientific worldview. To illustrate his point, Feyerabend
compares the defenders of a strong, value-free notion of objectivity
to scientists who stick to the concepts of absolute length and time in
spite of the Theory of Relativity. A staunch defense of objectivity
and value freedom may just expose our own narrow-mindedness. This is
not meant to say that truth loses its function as a normative concept
in science, nor that all scientific claims are equally
acceptable. Rather, Feyerabend demands that we move toward a genuine
<strong>epistemic pluralism</strong> that accepts diverse approaches
to searching an acquiring knowledge. In such an epistemic pluralism,
science may regain its objectivity in the sense of respecting the
diversity of values and traditions that drive our inquiries about the
world (1978: 106&ndash;107).</p>

<p>All this has a political aspect, too. In the times of the
scientific revolution or the Enlightenment, science acted as a
liberating force that fought intellectual and political oppression by
the sovereign, the nobility or the clergy. Nowadays, Feyerabend
continues, the ideals of value-freedom and objectivity are often
abused for excluding non-experts from science, proving the superiority
of the Western way of life, and undergirding the power of an
intellectual elite.</p>

<p>(Here it is important to keep in mind that Feyerabend's writings on
this issue date mostly from the 1970s and were much influenced by the
Civil Rights Movement in the US and the increasing emancipation of
minorities, such as Blacks, Asians and Hispanics.)</p>

<p>Feyerabend therefore argues that democratic societies need to exert
much greater control over scientific research. Laymen have to
supervise science. This includes areas where even defenders of the VFI
refrain from demanding value freedom, such as setting up a research
agenda, distributing funds, and supervising scientific inquiry. But it
also concerns areas that are more central to the VFI, such as the
choice of a research method or the assessment of scientific
theories. Contrary to commonly held beliefs, lack of specialized
training need not imply lack of relevant knowledge (1975:
xiii). Feyerabend sums up his view as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a community will use science and scientists in a way that agrees
with its values and aims and it will correct the scientific
institutions in its midst to bring them closer to these aims. (1975:
251)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a id="ObjFrePerBia">4. Objectivity as Freedom from Personal Biases</a></h2>

<p>This section deals with scientific objectivity as a form of
intersubjectivity&mdash;as freedom from personal biases. According to
this view, science is objective to the extent that personal biases are
absent from scientific reasoning, or that they can be eliminated in a
social process. Perhaps all science is necessarily
perspectival. Perhaps we cannot sensibly draw scientific inferences
without a host of background assumptions, which may include
assumptions about values. But scientific results should certainly not
depend on researchers' personal preferences or idiosyncratic
experiences. That, among other things, is what distinguishes science
from the arts and other more individualistic human activities&mdash;or
so it is said. Paradigmatic ways to achieve objectivity in this sense
are measurement and quantification. What has been measured and
quantified has been verified relative to a standard. The truth, say,
that the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall is relative to a standard
unit and conventions about how to use certain instruments, so it is
neither aperspectival nor free from assumptions, but it is independent
of the person making the measurement.</p>

<p>We will begin with a discussion of objectivity, so conceived, in
measurement, discuss the ideal of &ldquo;mechanical objectivity&rdquo;
and then investigate to what extent freedom from personal biases can
be implemented in statistical and inductive inference&mdash;arguably
the core of scientific reasoning, especially in experimentally working
sciences.</p>

<h3><a id="MeaQua">4.1 Measurement and Quantification</a></h3>

<p>Measurement is often thought to epitomize scientific objectivity,
most famously captured in Lord Kelvin's dictum </p>

<blockquote><p>
when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre
and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you
have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of
<em>science</em>, whatever the matter may be. (Kelvin
1883)</p></blockquote>

<p>Measurement can certainly achieve some independence of
perspective. Yesterday's weather in Durham UK may have been
&ldquo;really hot&rdquo; to the average North Eastern Brit and
&ldquo;very cold&rdquo; to the average Mexican, but they'll both
accept that it was 21&deg;C. Clearly, however, measurement does not
result in a &ldquo;view from nowhere&rdquo;, nor are typical
measurement results free from presuppositions. Measurement instruments
interact with the environment, and so results will always be a product
of both the properties of the environment we aim to measure as well as
the properties of the instrument. Instruments, thus, provide a
perspectival view on the world (cf. Giere 2006).</p>

<p>Moreover, making sense of measurement results requires
interpretation. Consider temperature measurement. Thermometers
function by relating an unobservable quantity, temperature, to an
observable quantity, expansion (or length) of a fluid or gas in a
glass tube; that is, thermometers measure temperature by assuming that
length is a function of temperature: length = \(f\)(temperature). The
function \(f\) is not known <em>a priori</em>, and it cannot be tested
either (because it could in principle only be tested using a
<em>veridical</em> thermometer, and the veridicality of the
thermometer is just what is at stake here). Making a specific
assumption, for instance that \(f\) is linear, solves that problem by
fiat. But this &ldquo;solution&rdquo; does not take us very far
because different thermometric substances (e.g., mercury, air or
water) yield different results for the points intermediate between the
two fixed points 0&deg;C and 100&deg;C, and so they can't all expand
linearly.</p>

<p>In Hasok Chang's account of early thermometry (Chang 2004), the
problem was eventually solved by using a &ldquo;principle of
minimalist overdetermination&rdquo;, whose goal it was to find a
reliable thermometer while making as few substantial assumptions
(e.g., about the form for <i>f</i>) as possible. It was argued,
eventually, that if a thermometer was to be reliable, different tokens
of the same thermometer type should agree with each other, and the
results of air thermometers agreed the most. &ldquo;Minimal&rdquo;
doesn't mean zero, however, and indeed this procedure makes an
important presupposition (in this case a metaphysical assumption about
the one-valuedness of a physical quantity). Moreover, the procedure
yielded at best a reliable instrument, not necessarily one that was
best at tracking the uniquely real temperature (if there is such a
thing).</p>

<p>What Chang argues about early thermometry is true of measurement
more generally. Measurements are always made against a backdrop of
metaphysical presuppositions, theoretical expectations and other kinds
of belief. Whether or not any given procedure is regarded as adequate
depends to a large extent on the purposes pursued by the individual
scientist or group of scientists making the measurements. Especially
in the social sciences, this often means that measurement procedures
are laden with normative assumptions, i.e., values.</p>

<p>Julian Reiss (2008, 2013) has argued that economic indicators such
as consumer price inflation, gross domestic product and the
unemployment rate are value-laden in this sense. Consumer-price
indices, for instance, assume that if a consumer prefers a bundle
<i>x</i> over an alternative <i>y</i>, then <i>x</i> is better for her
than <i>y</i>, which is as ethically charged as it is
controversial. National income measures assume that nations that
exchange a larger share of goods and services on markets are richer
than nations where the same goods and services are provided by the
government, which too is as ethically charged and controversial.</p>

<p>While not free of assumptions and values, the goal of many
measurement procedures remains to reduce the influence of personal
biases and idiosyncrasies. The Nixon administration, famously, indexed
social security payments to the consumer-price index in order to
eliminate the dependence of security recipients on the flimsiest of
party politics: to make increases automatic instead of a result of
political negotiations (Nixon 1969). Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison
refer to this as <strong>mechanical objectivity</strong>. They
write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we come to the full-fledged establishment of mechanical
objectivity as the ideal of scientific representation. What we find is
that the image, as standard bearer of is objectivity is tied to a
relentless search to replace individual volition and discretion in
depiction by the invariable routines of mechanical
reproduction. (Daston and Galison 1992: 98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The artist Salvador Dal&iacute;, no doubt unwittingly, describes his
surrealist paintings as a product of mechanical objectivity in Daston
and Galison's sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In truth I am no more than an automaton that registers, without
judgment and as exactly as possible, the dictate of my subconscious:
my dreams, hypnagogic images and visions, and all the concrete and
irrational manifestations of the dark and sensational world discovered
by Freud. (Dal&iacute; 1935)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mechanical objectivity reduces the importance of human
contributions to scientific results to a minimum, and therefore
enables science to proceed on a large scale where bonds of trust
between individuals can no longer hold (Daston 1992). Trust in
mechanical procedures thus replaces trust in individual
scientists.</p>

<p>In his book <em>Trust in Numbers</em>, Theodore Porter pursues this
line of thought in great detail. In particular, on the basis of case
studies involving British actuaries in the mid-nineteenth century, of
French state engineers throughout the century, and of the US Army
Corps of Engineers from 1920 to 1960, he argues for two causal
claims. First, measurement instruments and quantitative procedures
originate in commercial and administrative needs and affect the ways
in which the natural and social sciences are practiced, not the other
way around. The mushrooming of instruments such as chemical balances,
barometers, chronometers was largely a result of social pressures and
the demands of democratic societies. Administering large territories
or controlling diverse people and processes is not always possible on
the basis of personal trust and thus &ldquo;objective
procedures&rdquo; (which do not require trust in persons) took the
place of &ldquo;subjective judgments&rdquo; (which do). Second, he
argues that quantification is a technology of distrust and weakness,
and not of strength. It is weak administrators who do not have the
social status, political support or professional solidarity to defend
their experts' judgments. They therefore subject decisions to public
scrutiny, which means that they must be made in a publicly accessible
form.</p>

<p>This is the situation in which scientists who work in areas where
the science/policy boundary is fluid find themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences has accepted the principle that
scientists should declare their conflicts of interest and financial
holdings before offering policy advice, or even information to the
government. And while police inspections of notebooks remain
exceptional, the personal and financial interests of scientists and
engineers are often considered material, especially in legal and
regulatory contexts.</p>

<p>Strategies of impersonality must be understood partly as defenses
against such suspicions [&hellip;]. Objectivity means knowledge that
does not depend too much on the particular individuals who author
it. (Porter 1995: 229)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Measurement and quantification help to reduce the influence of
personal biases and idiosyncrasies and they reduce the need to trust
the scientist or government official, but often at a
cost. Standardizing scientific procedures becomes difficult when their
subject matters are not homogeneous, and few domains outside
fundamental physics are. Attempts to quantify procedures for treatment
and policy decisions that we find in evidence-based practices are
currently transferred to a variety of sciences such as medicine,
nursing, psychology, education and social policy. However, they often
lack a certain degree of responsiveness to the peculiarities of their
subjects and the local conditions to which they are applied (see also
<a href="#EviBasMedSocPol">section 5.3</a>).</p>

<p>Moreover, the measurement and quantification of characteristics of
scientific interest is only half of the story. We also want to
describe relations between the quantities and make inferences using
statistical analysis. Statistics thus helps to quantify further
aspects of scientific work. We will now turn to the question whether
or not statistical analysis can proceed in a way free from personal
biases and idiosyncrasies.</p>

<h3><a id="IndStaInf">4.2 Inductive and Statistical Inference</a></h3>

<p>The appraisal of scientific evidence is traditionally regarded as a
domain of scientific reasoning where the ideal of scientific
objectivity has strong normative force, and where it is also
well-entrenched in scientific practice. Episodes such as Galilei's
observations of the Jupiter moons, Lavoisier's calcination
experiments, and Eddington's observation of the 1919 eclipse are found
in all philosophy of science textbooks because they exemplify how
evidence can be persuasive and compelling to scientists with different
backgrounds. The crucial question is therefore: can we identify an
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; concept of scientific evidence that is
independent of the personal biases of the experimenter and
interpreter?</p>

<p>Inferential statistics&mdash;the field that investigates the
validity of inferences from data to theory&mdash;tries to answer this
question. It is extremely influential in modern science. For instance,
the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson was established through a
statistical argument, based on the idea that what is
&ldquo;significant&rdquo; for one researcher should also be
significant for another. Therefore, this subsection compares the main
schools of inductive/statistical inference with respect to their
objectivity claims.</p>

<h4><a id="LogProBayInf">4.2.1 Logical Probability and Bayesian Inference</a></h4>

<p>In <a href="#AccSciHypValNeu">section 3.2</a>, we have encountered
the idea of a scientist who assesses the probability of a hypothesis
in the light of the evidence&mdash;a conception based on Rudolf
Carnap's seminal work &ldquo;Logical Foundations of Probability&rdquo;
(1950 [1962]). Carnap is interested in determining the <strong>degree
of confirmation</strong> of a hypothesis relative to a given set of
observations. Carnap starts out by explicating this concept in a
clear-cut, simple setting: a first-order language \(\mathcal{L}\) with
finitely many monadic predicates and infinitely many individual
constants. Carnap then considers all maximally specific descriptions
of states of the world in \(\mathcal{L}\) and assigns a measure \(m\) over
these descriptions. Subsequently, the available observations <i>E</i>
are conceptualized as a conjunction of
\(\mathcal{L}\)-statements. Finally, the degree of confirmation of
hypothesis <i>H</i>, represented as an \(\mathcal{L}\)-proposition, is
calculated according to the formula:</p>

<p>\[c(H, E) = \frac{m(H \wedge E)}{m(E)} \tag{1}\]</p>

<p>In other words, the degree of confirmation of hypothesis <i>H</i>
relative to <i>E</i> is the conditional probability of <i>H</i> given
<em>E</em>. But is this probability an objective quantity and free
from personal bias?</p>

<p>The answer to this question stands and falls with the choice of the
\(m\)-function. Not all are equally suited: for example, assigning equal
weight to all complete state descriptions would not allow for learning
from experience. Carnap himself admits that no conclusive argument for
a specific \(m\) can be made. In later work, he therefore parametrized
the choice of a \(m\)-function by a parameter \(\lambda\) that expressed
the respective impact of logical and empirical considerations on
prediction.</p>

<p>Carnap's probability logic has often been described as an
&ldquo;inductive automaton&rdquo;. But these comments miss the point:
they neglect the subjective choices on which the inductive inferences
are built. Carnap's approach is objective in so far as the degree of
confirmation is intersubjectively compelling once a logical language
and appropriate symmetry principles for this language are agreed upon;
however, it is subjective in the sense that rational agents may
disagree on these principles. See also the entry on
 <a href="../logic-inductive/">inductive logic</a>.</p>

<p>Closely related to Carnap's logical probability framework is the
Bayesian approach to confirmation and evidence, developed first by
Frank Ramsey. It is outspokenly subjective: probability is used for
quantifying a scientist's subjective <strong>degrees of
belief</strong> in a particular hypothesis. These degrees of belief
are changed by <strong>conditionalization</strong> on observed
evidence <i>E</i> and making use of <strong>Bayes'
Theorem</strong>:</p>

<p>\[\tag{2}\label{eqn:Bayes}

   p_{\text{new}}(H) := p(H \mid E) = p(H) \frac{p(E \mid H)}{p(E)}\]</p>

<p>The credibility of a hypothesis <i>H</i> in the face of evidence
<i>E</i> is then judged by its conditional probability \(p(H \mid E\),
commonly called the <strong>posterior (probability)</strong> of
<i>H</i>, as opposed to the <strong>prior (probability)</strong>
\(p(H)\). These days, the Bayesian approach is extremely influential in
philosophy, but also in scientific disciplines such as statistics,
economics, and biology. The difference between the Bayesian approach
and Carnap's lies in the philosophical motivation, and in the
different understanding of confirmation judgments: for Carnap, they
are primarily a consequence of certain logical ways of carving the
world at its joints; for the Bayesian, they express a genuinely
subjective uncertainty judgment. See also the entry on 
 <a href="../bayes-theorem/">Bayes theorem</a>.</p>

<p>Can we ground the objectivity of scientific evidence in a framework
that is explicitly based on personal attitudes? Some authors have
argued that measuring &ldquo;mere psychological tendencies&rdquo;
(Fisher 1935: 6&ndash;7) such as degrees of belief cannot be relevant
for scientific inquiry. Bayesians have supplied several arguments to
the effect that subjective probability is not equal to personal bias,
which we will review in turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As argued by Howson (2000) and Howson and Urbach (1993), the
Bayesian's aim is not to determine an intersubjectively binding degree
of confirmation, but to provide sound inference rules for learning
from experience. In the same way that deductive logic does not judge
the correctness of the premises but just advises you what to infer
from them, <strong>Bayesian inductive logic</strong> tells you how to
change your own attitudes as soon as you encounter evidence. All other
updating rules are susceptible to so-called <em>Dutch books</em>:
betting based on following such rules will lead to sure monetary
losses. In addition, convergence theorems guarantee that, as long as
novel evidence keeps coming in, the degrees of belief of agents with
very different initial attitudes will finally converge (Gaifman and
Snir 1982). However, one may object that the real problem does not lie
with the internal soundness of the updating process, but with the
choice of an appropriate prior, which may be beset with idiosyncratic
bias and manifest social values.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Modern Bayesians prefer to measure degree of confirmation in terms
of the <strong>increase in degree of belief</strong> that evidence
<i>E</i> confers on hypothesis <i>H</i>, rather than the probability
of <i>H</i> conditional on <i>E</i>. Several philosophers have argued
that there is just one reasonable measure of confirmation as increase
in degree of belief that satisfies a set of generally accepted
desirable constraints (e.g., Good 1950; Kemeny and Oppenheim 1952;
Crupi, Tentori and Gonzalez 2007). If one of these arguments were
sound, then the incremental degree of confirmation would provide a
bias-free assessment of the evidence. To date, none of the
&ldquo;uniqueness theorems&rdquo; for a specific measure of
confirmation has gained general acceptance in the philosophical
community. For solving applied problems, however, Bayesian
statisticians almost uniformly use the <strong>Bayes factor</strong>,
that is, the ratio of prior to posterior odds in favor of a
hypothesis. In the case of two parametric hypotheses \(H_0: \theta \in
\Theta_0\) vs. \(H_1: \theta \in \Theta_1\), the Bayes factor can be
written as:</p>

<p>\[\tag{3}\label{eqn:BF} B_{01} (x) := \frac{p(H_0 \mid x)}{p(H_1
\mid x)} \cdot \frac{p(H_1)}{p(H_0)} = \frac{\int_{\theta \in
\Theta_0} p(x \mid \theta) p(\theta) d\theta}{\int_{\theta \in
\Theta_1} p(x \mid \theta) p(\theta) d\theta}\]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bayesian approach can eliminate personal bias by imposing
additional constraints on an agent's rational degrees of belief. One
way to do so consists in adopting the <strong>Principle of Maximum
Entropy</strong> or MaxEnt, going back to Jaynes (1968) and developed
philosophically by Jon Williamson (2010). Williamson retains the
demand that degrees of belief satisfy the probability axioms, but
dismisses the updating by conditionalization in equation (2). Instead,
he demands that the agent's degrees of belief must be in sync with
empirical constraints and that, conditional on these constraints, they
must be <strong>equivocal</strong>, that is, as middling as
possible. This latter constraint amounts to maximizing the entropy of
the probability distribution in question. If \(\omega\) denotes the
&ldquo;atoms&rdquo; of the relevant \(\sigma\)-algebra, the entropy is
given by the term</p>

<p>\[\tag{4}\label{eqn:MaxEnt}

H = -\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} p(\omega) \log p(\omega)\]</p>

<p>Since maximizing the right hand side in (4) leads to a unique
solution, subjective bias is eliminated. Instead of going for MaxEnt,
one could also assume <strong>objective priors</strong>, that is,
prior probabilities which do not represent an agent's factual
attitudes, but are determined by principles of symmetry, mathematical
convenience or maximizing the influence of the data on the posterior
(e.g., Jeffreys 1939 [1980]; Bernardo 2012). In general, however, the
practical achievements of objective Bayesian approaches come at the
expense of weakening their philosophical foundations (e.g., Sprenger
2012).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, Bayesianism provides not more than a partial answer to
securing scientific objectivity from personal idiosyncrasy. On the
other hand, the objections to the above proposals are no knockout
arguments, and further developments of the discussed approaches may
help to reconcile transparency about subjective assumptions with
objectivity in interpreting statistical evidence.</p>

<p>That said, one may argue that the theories we discussed so far all
miss the target. Bayesians primarily address the question of which
theories we should rationally <strong>believe</strong> in. The
decision procedures reviewed in
 <a href="#AccSciHypValNeu">section 3.2</a> respond to the
 question of what we should
<strong>do</strong>. Both analyze the concept of <strong>statistical
evidence</strong> from the vantage point of their primary
focus&mdash;beliefs and decisions. But can't we quantify the support
for or against a hypothesis in an intersubjectively compelling way,
without buying into a subjectivist or a behavioral framework? This is
the ambition of frequentist and likelihood-based explications of
scientific evidence.</p>

<h4><a id="FreInf">4.2.2 Frequentist Inference</a></h4>

<p>The frequentist conception of evidence is based on the idea of the
<strong>statistical test of a hypothesis</strong>. Under the influence
of the statisticians Neyman and Pearson, tests were often regarded as
rational <strong>decision procedures</strong> that minimize the
relative frequency of wrong decisions in a hypothetical series of
repetitions of a test. As we have seen in
 <a href="#AccSciHypValNeu">section 3.2</a>, the choice of thresholds in
such tests may reflect contextual value judgments and personal
bias. Moreover, the losses associated with erroneously accepting or
rejecting that hypothesis depend on the context of application which
may be unbeknownst to the experimenter. This speaks for a division of
labor where scientists restrict themselves to an <strong>evidential
interpretation of statistical tests</strong>, and leave the actual
decisions to policy-makers and regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>Such an approach has been developed by Ronald A. Fisher
(1890&ndash;1962), and it has become the orthodox solution to
statistical inference problems. Fisher reasons that if an observed
result is &ldquo;extreme&rdquo;, then it provides evidence against
that hypothesis. In other words, if a result has lower probability
under the null hypothesis <i>H</i> than most other possible results,
then it undermines the tenability of <i>H</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>either an exceptionally rare chance has occurred, or the theory
[=the null hypothesis] is not true. (Fisher 1956: 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, the strength of evidence against the tested hypothesis is
equal to the <strong>p-value</strong>&mdash;the probability of
obtaining a result that is as least as extreme as the actually
observed data. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> gives a graphical
illustration. This probability measures how strongly <i>E</i> speaks
against <i>H</i>, compared to other possible results, and the lower it
is, the stronger the evidence against <i>H</i>. Fisher interpreted the
p-value as &ldquo;a measure of the rational grounds for the
<em>disbelief</em> [in the null hypothesis] it augments&rdquo; (Fisher
1956: 43). Conventionally, a p-value smaller than .05 is classified as
&ldquo;significant evidence&rdquo;, a p-value smaller than .01 is
called &ldquo;very significant evidence&rdquo;, etc. This basic idea
is also underlying Mayo's (1996) error-statistical theory of evidence,
although she focus on the &ldquo;severity&rdquo; of a test (that is,
the observed power).</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">
<img src="pvalue.jpg" title="" alt="Standard Normal density. Size of shaded area = p-value. The graph itself has a y-axis from 0.0 to 0.4 and a x-axis from -3 to 3.  The bell shaped curve has its peak at (0,.4) and minimums at (-3,0) and (3,0).  The shaded area under the curve is for x values -3 to -1.8 and 1.8 to 3 with max y value of .072." />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> The p-value, represented as
the shaded area under the probability density of the tested hypothesis
\(X \sim N(0,1)\), for observed data \(x=1.8\) \((p=0.072)\).</p>
</div>

<p>This concept of evidence is apparently objective, but beset with a
variety of problems (see Sprenger 2014 for a detailed
discussion). First, the famous 5% threshold for statistical
significance is clearly arbitrary and anything but objective. There is
no intersubjectively compelling justification why this or any other
particular standard of evidence should be used in order to quantify
the concept of significance. As statisticians put it, &ldquo;God loves
the .06 [i.e., a 6% threshold] nearly as much as the .05&rdquo;
(Rosnow and Rosenthal 1989: 1277).</p>

<p>From an institutional point of view, the frequentist conception of
p-values is problematic as well. Not only does the automatic use of
conventional significance levels imply that much valuable research is
suppressed, because &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; results have no chance
of publication. What is more, even in the absence of a causal relation
between two quantities, one may find a significant (and therefore
publishable) result by pure chance. The probability that this happens
by accident is equal to the statistical significance threshold (i.e.,
5%) and plausible plausibly larger than the probability that we detect
one of the relatively rare true causal relations. Ioannidis (2005)
therefore concludes that <strong>most published research findings are
false</strong>&mdash;an effect partially due to the frequentist logic
of evidence. Indeed, researchers often fail to replicate findings by
another scientific team, and periods of excitement and subsequent
disappointment are not uncommon in frontier science.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a principled philosophical objection against the
objectivity of frequentist evidence: the <strong>sample space
dependence</strong>. That is, in frequentist statistics, the strength
of the evidence depends on <em>which results could have been
observed</em> (but were not observed). For instance, the
post-experimental assessment of the evidence has to be changed when we
learn about a defect in our measurement instrument, even if that
defect is not relevant for the range of the actually observed results!
On a Bayesian reading, this implies that frequentist evidence
statements depend on the <em>intentions</em> of the experimenter
(Edwards, Lindman and Savage 1963; Sprenger 2009): Would she have
continued the trial if the results had been different? How would she
have reacted to unforeseen circumstances? Freedom from personal bias
seems hard to realize if one's inference depends on the answer to such
questions.</p>

<h4><a id="LikBasInf">4.2.3 Likelihood-Based Inference</a></h4>

<p>A middle ground between frequentist and Bayesian inference is
provided by likelihoodist inference, based on Alan Turing and
I.J. Good's work on breaking the Enigma code during World War
II. Their research yielded a theory of evidence where instead of
asking to what extent evidence <i>E</i> supports hypothesis <i>H</i>,
it is measured how much <i>E</i> favors <i>H</i> over an alternative
\(H'\) (Good 1950). In this approach, the canonical measure of
<strong>weight of evidence</strong> \(w\) is explicated as</p>

<p>\[\tag{5}\label{eqn:WoE}

w(E, H, H') = \log \frac{p(E \mid H)}{p(E \mid H')}\]</p>

<p>of which the Bayes factor mentioned before is a generalization. A
conception of statistical evidence based on \(w\) or monotonic
transformations of \(w\) is called a <strong>likelihood-based theory of
evidence</strong>. This is because the probabilities of the actual
evidence <i>E</i> under the competing hypotheses are called the
<strong>likelihoods of <i>H</i> on E</strong>.</p>

<p>Whenever \(H\) and \(H'\) imply specific statistical distributions
for the observed evidence, this measure can be calculated in an
objective, subject-independent way. Therefore, a minority of
statisticians (e.g., Royall 1997) uses this measure as a fundamental
notion of evidence, and philosophers such as Hacking (1965) and Sober
(2008) have applied this concept of evidence to various issues in
formal epistemology, inductive logic and philosophy of biology.</p>

<p>However, the scope of \(w\) is restricted. In routinely testing the
values of the mean or variance of a distribution, \(H'\) is often a
composite hypothesis whose components are indexed by a parameter
\(\theta\) (e.g., \(H: \theta = \theta_0\) is tested against \(H': \theta
\ne \theta_0\)). A Bayesian would then appeal to subjective belief
attitudes toward the individual hypotheses \(H_\theta\), calculate \(p(E)
= \sum_{\theta} p(H_\theta) p(E \mid H_\theta)\) and update her beliefs
by conditionalization. However, the likelihoodist cannot use
subjective probability in order to transform a composite hypothesis
into a simple one. Therefore, for composite statistical hypotheses, we
either have to compromise the objectivity of \(w(E, H, H')\) by
introducing subjective weightings, or we have to weaken the conceptual
arguments in favor of \(w\), e.g., by switching to comparing maximum
likelihoods.</p>

<p>Summing up our findings, no statistical theory of evidence manages
to eliminate all sources of personal bias and idiosyncrasy. The
Bayesian is honest about it: she considers subjective assumptions to
be ineliminable from scientific reasoning. This does not rule out that
constrastive aspects of statistical evidence may be quantified in an
objective way, e.g., by using Bayes factors. On that point, the
Bayesian agrees with the likelihoodist, who has perhaps the
&ldquo;purest&rdquo; model of objective statistical evidence, but also
the one with the most restricted scope. The frequentist conception
based on p-values still dominates statistical practice, but it suffers
from several conceptual drawbacks, and in particular the misleading
impression of objectivity. This also has far-reaching implications for
fields such as evidence-based medicine, where randomized controlled
trials (the most valuable source of evidence) are typically
interpreted in a frequentist way. A defense of frequentist inference
should, in our opinion, stress that the relatively rigid rules for
interpreting statistical evidence facilitate communication and
assessment of research results in the scientific
community&mdash;something that is harder to achieve for a
Bayesian.</p>

<h2><a id="IssSpeSci">5. Issues in the Special Sciences</a></h2>

<p>So far everything we discussed was meant to apply across all or at
least most of the sciences. In this section we will look at a number
of specific issues that arise in the social science, in economics, and
in evidence-based medicine.</p>

<h3><a id="MaxWebObjSocSci">5.1 Max Weber and Objectivity in the Social Sciences</a></h3>

<p>There is a long tradition in the philosophy of social science
maintaining that there is a gulf in terms of both goals as well as
methods between the natural and the social sciences. This tradition,
associated with thinkers such as the neo-Kantians Heinrich Rickert and
Wilhelm Windelband, the hermeneuticist Wilhelm Dilthey, the
sociologist-economist Max Weber, and the twentieth-century
hermeneuticists Hans-Georg Gadamer and Michael Oakeshott, holds that
unlike the natural sciences whose aim it is to establish natural laws
and which proceed by experimentation and causal analysis, the social
sciences seek understanding (&ldquo;<em>Verstehen</em>&rdquo;) of
social phenomena, the interpretive examination of the meanings
individuals attribute to their actions (Rickert 1929/1986; Windelband
1915; Dilthey 2002; Weber 1904b [1949]; Gadamer 1989; Oakeshott
1933). See also the entries on 
 <a href="../hermeneutics/">hermeneutics</a> and 
 <a href="../weber/">Max Weber</a>.
</p>

<p>Understood this way, social science lacks objectivity in more than
one sense. One of the more important debates concerning objectivity in
the social sciences concerns the role value judgments play and,
importantly, whether value-laden research entails claims about the
desirability of actions. Max Weber held that the social sciences are
necessarily value laden. However, they can achieve some degree of
objectivity by keeping out the social researcher's views about whether
agents' goals are commendable. In a similar vein, contemporary
economics can be said to be value laden because it predicts and
explains social phenomena on the basis of agents'
preferences. Nevertheless, economists are adamant that economists are
not in the business of telling people what they ought to value. Modern
economics is thus said to be objective in the Weberian sense of
<strong>&ldquo;absence of researchers' values&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;a
conception that we discussed in detail in
 <a href="#ObjAbsNorComValFreIde">section 3</a>.</p>

<p>In his widely cited essay &ldquo;&lsquo;Objectivity&rsquo; in
Social Science and Social Policy&rdquo; (Weber 1904a [1949]), Weber
argued that the idea of an aperspectival social science was
meaningless:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no absolutely objective scientific analysis of [&hellip;]
&ldquo;social phenomena&rdquo; independent of special and
&ldquo;one-sided&rdquo; viewpoints according to which expressly or
tacitly, consciously or unconsciously they are selected, analyzed and
organized for expository purposes.  (p. 72)</p>

<p>All knowledge of cultural reality, as may be seen, is always
knowledge from particular points of view. (p. 81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason for this is twofold. First, social reality is too
complex to admit of full description and explanation. So we have to
select. But, perhaps in contraposition to the natural sciences, we
cannot just select those aspects of the phenomena that fall under
universal natural laws and treat everything else as
&ldquo;unintegrated residues&rdquo; (p. 73). This is because, second,
in the social sciences we want to understand social phenomena in their
individuality, that is, in their unique configurations that have
significance for us.</p>

<p>Values solve a selection problem. They tell us what research
questions we ought to address because they inform us about the
cultural importance of social phenomena:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only a small portion of existing concrete reality is colored by our
value-conditioned interest and it alone is significant to us. It is
significant because it reveals relationships which are important to
use due to their connection with our values.  (p. 76)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that Weber did not think that social and
natural science were different in kind, as Dilthey and others
did. Social science too examines the causes of phenomena of interest,
and natural science too often seeks to explain natural phenomena in
their individual constellations. The role of causal laws is different
in the two fields, however. Whereas establishing a causal law is often
an end in itself in the natural sciences, in the social sciences laws
play an attenuated and accompanying role as mere means to explain
cultural phenomena in their uniqueness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for Weber social science remained objective in at
least two ways. First, once research questions of interest have been
settled, answers about the causes of culturally significant phenomena
do not depend on the idiosyncrasies of an individual researcher:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it obviously does not follow from this that research in the
cultural sciences can only have results which are
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo; in the sense that they are valid for one
person and not for others. [&hellip;] For scientific truth is
precisely what is valid for all who seek the truth.  (Weber 1904a
[1949]: 84, emphasis original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claims of social science can therefore be objective in our
third sense (<a href="#ObjFrePerBia">see section 4</a>). Moreover, by
determining that a given phenomenon is &ldquo;culturally
significant&rdquo; a researcher reflects on whether or not a practice
is &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; or &ldquo;important&rdquo;, and not
whether or not it is commendable: &ldquo;Prostitution is a cultural
phenomenon just as much as religion or money&rdquo; (p. 81). An
important implication of this view came to the fore in the so-called
&ldquo;<em>Werturteilsstreit</em>&rdquo; (quarrel concerning value
judgments) of the early 1900's. In this debate, Weber maintained
against the &ldquo;socialists of the lectern&rdquo; around Gustav
Schmoller the position that social scientists qua scientists should
not be directly involved in policy debates because it was not the aim
of science to examine the appropriateness of ends. Given a policy
goal, a social scientist could make recommendations about effective
strategies to reach the goal; but social science was to be value-free
in the sense of not taking a stance on the desirability of the goals
themselves. This leads us to our conception of objectivity as freedom
from values.</p>

<h3><a id="ConRatChoThe">5.2 Contemporary Rational Choice Theory</a></h3>

<p>Contemporary mainstream economists hold a view concerning
objectivity that mirrors Max Weber's (see above). On the one hand, it
is clear that value judgments are at the heart of economic
theorizing. &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; are a key concept of rational
choice theory, the main theory in contemporary mainstream
economics. Preferences are evaluations. If an individual prefers
<i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, she <em>values</em> <i>A</i> higher than
<i>B</i> (Hausman 2012). Thus, to the extent that economists predict
and explain market behavior in terms of rational choice theory, they
predict and explain market behavior in a way laden with value
judgments.</p>

<p>However, economists are not themselves supposed to take a stance
about whether or not whatever individuals value is also
&ldquo;objectively&rdquo; good in a stronger sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] that an agent is rational from [rational choice
theory]'s point of view does not mean that the course of action she
will choose is objectively optimal. Desires do not have to align with
any objective measure of &ldquo;goodness&rdquo;: I may want to risk
swimming in a crocodile-infested lake; I may desire to smoke or drink
even though I know it harms me. Optimality is determined by the
agent's desires, not the converse.  (Paternotte 2011: 307&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a similar vein, Gul and Pesendorfer write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, standard economics has no therapeutic ambition, i.e., it
does not try to evaluate or improve the individual's
objectives. Economics cannot distinguish between choices that maximize
happiness, choices that reflect a sense of duty, or choices that are
the response to some impulse. Moreover, standard economics takes no
position on the question of which of those objectives the agent should
pursue.  (Gul and Pesendorfer 2008: 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the standard view, all that rational choice theory
demands is that people's preferences are (internally) consistent; it
has no business in telling people what they ought to prefer, whether
their preferences are consistent with external norms or
values. Economics is thus value-laden, but laden with the values of
the agents whose behavior it seeks to predict and explain and not with
the values of those who seek to predict and explain this behavior.</p>

<p>Whether or not social science, and economics in particular, can be
objective in this&mdash;Weber's and the contemporary
economists'&mdash;sense is controversial. On the one hand, there are
some reasons to believe that rational choice theory (which is at work
not only in economics but also in political science and other social
sciences) cannot be applied to empirical phenomena without referring
to external norms or values (Sen 1993; Reiss 2013).</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not clear that economists and other social
scientists qua social scientists shouldn't participate in a debate
about social goals. For one thing, trying to do welfare analysis in
the standard Weberian way tends to obscure rather than to eliminate
normative commitments (Putnam and Walsh 2007). Obscuring value
judgments can be detrimental to the social scientist as policy adviser
because it will hamper rather than promote trust in social
science. For another, economists are in a prime position to contribute
to ethical debates, for a variety of reasons, and should therefore
take this responsibility seriously (Atkinson 2001).</p>

<h3><a id="EviBasMedSocPol">5.3 Evidence-based Medicine and Social Policy</a></h3>

<p>The same demands calling for &ldquo;mechanical objectivity&rdquo;
in the natural sciences and quantification in the social and policy
sciences in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and mid-20<sup>th</sup>
century are responsible for a recent movement in biomedical research,
which, even more recently, have swept to contemporary social science
and policy. Early proponents of so-called &ldquo;evidence-based
medicine&rdquo; made their pursuit of a downplay of the &ldquo;human
element&rdquo; in medicine plain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence-based medicine de-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic
clinical experience, and pathophysiological rationale as sufficient
grounds for clinical decision making and stresses the examination of
evidence from clinical research.  (Guyatt et al. 1992: 2420)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To call the new movement &ldquo;evidence-based&rdquo; is a misnomer
strictly speaking, as intuition, clinical experience and
pathophysiological rationale can certainly constitute evidence. But
proponents of evidence-based practices have a much narrower concept of
evidence in mind: analyses of the results of randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). This movement is now very strong in biomedical
research, development economics and a number of areas of social
science, especially psychology, education and social policy,
especially in the English speaking world.</p>

<p>The goal is to replace subjective (biased, error-prone,
idiosyncratic) judgments by mechanically objective methods. But, as in
other areas, attempting to mechanize inquiry can lead to reduced
accuracy and utility of the results.</p>

<p>Causal relations in the social and biomedical sciences hold on
account of highly complex arrangements of factors and
conditions. Whether for instance a substance is toxic depends on
details of the metabolic system of the population ingesting it, and
whether an educational policy is effective on the constellation of
factors that affect the students' learning progress. If an RCT was
conducted successfully, the conclusion about the effectiveness of the
treatment (or toxicity of a substance) under test is certain for the
particular arrangement of factors and conditions of the trial
(Cartwright 2007). But unlike the RCT itself, many of whose aspects
can be (relatively) mechanically implemented, applying the result to a
new setting (recommending a treatment to a patient, for instance)
always involves subjective judgments of the kind proponents of
evidence-based practices seek to avoid&mdash;such as judgments about
the similarity of the test to the target or policy population.</p>

<p>On the other hand, RCTs can be regarded as &ldquo;debiasing
procedure&rdquo; because they prevent researchers from allocating
treatments to patients according to their personal interests, so that
the healthiest (or smartest or&hellip;) subjects get the researcher's
favorite therapy. While unbalanced allocations can certainly happen by
chance, randomization still provides some warrant that the allocation
was not done <em>on purpose</em> with a view to promoting somebody's
interests. <em>A priori</em>, the experimental procedure is thus more
impartial with respect to the interests at stake. It has thus been
argued that RCTs in medicine, while no guarantor of the best outcomes,
were adopted by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to
different degrees during the 1960s and 1970s in order to regain public
trust in its decisions about treatments, which it had lost due to the
thalidomide and other scandals (Reiss and Teira 2013; Teira 2010). It
is important to notice, however, that randomization is at best
effective with respect to one kind of bias, viz. selection
bias. Important other epistemic concerns are not addressed by the
procedure but should not be ignored (Worrall 2002).</p>

<h2><a id="InsRes">6. Instrumentalism to the Rescue?</a></h2>

<p>We have seen in <a href="#StaTheConEmpTruSci">sections 2.4</a> and
<a href="#MeaQua">4.1</a> that scientific objectivity and trust in
science are closely connected. We want scientific objectivity because
and to the extent that we want to be able to trust scientists, their
results and recommendations. One possible lesson to draw from the
fairly poor success record of the proposed conceptions of scientific
objectivity is that these conceptions have the logical order of the
ideas mistaken. They look at some privileged feature of science,
define this feature as &ldquo;objectivity-making&rdquo; and then leave
the issue of whether or not the feature also promotes trust to
fate. The obvious alternative is to reverse that order, start with
what we want and then look for features that might promote the thing
in which we are ultimately interested.</p>

<p>If ultimately it is trust in science we want, we might then define
as &ldquo;objective&rdquo; any feature of science that promotes trust
(cf. Fine 1998: 18). That is, anything goes&mdash;as long as the
practice promotes trust in science. In contraposition to the three
traditional alternatives, we may call this conception
<strong>instrumentalism about scientific objectivity</strong>.</p>

<p>From an instrumentalist point of view, defining the objective
features of scientific inquiry becomes an empirical and contextual
issue. It is empirical in that anything that stands in the right kind
of causal relation with public trust will count as an objective
feature of science. There is no way to tell <em>a priori</em> what
these features might be. It is contextual in that there is at least
the possibility that these features vary with time, place, discipline
and other contextual elements. It may well be, for instance, that one
or more of the three traditional understandings have once promoted
trust in science, even if they no longer do so. It may also be that it
is these features that promote trust in one science but not
others. And it may be that trust-making features vary with social and
political circumstances&mdash;different features may be salient in
different stages of development or between war and peace times and so
on.</p>

<p>The strong point of this way of thinking about objectivity is that
none of the threats discussed in the main body of this
article&mdash;threats posed by the difficulties with the &ldquo;view
from nowhere&rdquo;, with the value-free ideal, and with biases and
idiosyncrasies in science&mdash;puts scientific objectivity at
risk. There is no reason to think that sciences that represent the
world from a perspective, in which non-epistemic values play important
roles in scientific decision-making and in which personal elements
affect outcomes cannot be trusted by the public. Scientific
objectivity in the instrumentalist conception is thus both valuable,
as gives us something worth pursuing, <em>and</em> attainable.</p>

<p>At the same time, arguably, instrumentalism about objectivity is
more of a research program than an explication of the concept. Suppose
we have a domain of science which, at a particular place and time,
fares very well with respect to promoting public trust. How are we to
tell which features of these scientific practices are responsible for
the success? It is obviously impossible to run experiments. Just
observing and comparing historical episodes is not likely to clinch
results as there will always be numerous differences between any two
domains, historical episodes and places.</p>

<p>Moreover, if objectivity is identified with features that promote
trust in science, how do we prevent clever marketing from being a
crucial feature of scientific objectivity? Or suppose that a science
loses public trust (say, as macro and financial economics did after
the Financial Crisis after 2007). What might be effective strategies
to regain it? Arguably, instrumentalism raises more questions than it
answers.</p>

<p>Yet, instrumentalism faces none of the obvious difficulties of the
alternative views, so it might well be a worthwhile research
project. The challenge for proponents of traditional views of
objectivity consists in showing how specific features of their
favorite conception of objectivity (e.g., value freedom) secure the
epistemic authority of science independent of contextual constraints,
and how these features have been used at all times for supporting the
credibility of scientific claims. The instrumentalist and the
traditional research programs may therefore fruitfully complement each
other.</p>

<h2><a id="Con">7. Conclusions</a></h2>

<p>So is scientific objectivity desirable? Is it attainable? That, as
we have seen, depends crucially on how the term is understood. We have
looked in detail at three different conceptions of scientific
objectivity: faithfulness to facts, value-freedom and freedom from
personal biases. In each case, there are at least some reasons to
believe that either science cannot deliver full objectivity in this
sense, or that it would not be a good thing to try to do so, or
both. Does this mean we should give up the idea of objectivity in
science?</p>

<p>We have shown that it is hard to define scientific objectivity in
terms of a view from nowhere and freedom from values and from personal
bias. It is a lot harder to say anything positive about the
matter. Perhaps it is related to a thorough critical attitude
concerning claims and findings, as Popper thought. Perhaps it is the
fact that many voices are heard, equally respected and subjected to
accepted standards, as Longino defends. Perhaps it is something else
altogether. Perhaps it is a combination of several factors, including
some that have been discussed in this article.</p>

<p>However, one should not (as yet) throw out the baby with the
bathwater. Like those who defend a particular explication of
scientific objectivity, the critics struggle to explain what makes
science objective, trustworthy and special. For instance, our
discussion of the value-free ideal (VFI) revealed that alternatives to
the VFI are as least as problematic as the VFI itself, and that the
VFI may, with all its inadequacies, still be a useful heuristic for
fostering scientific integrity and objectivity. Similarly, although an
&ldquo;unbiased&rdquo; science may be impossible, there are many
mechanisms scientists can adopt for protecting their reasoning against
undesirable forms of bias, e.g., choosing an appropriate method of
statistical inference.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it should come as no surprise that finding a
positive characterization of what makes science objective is hard. If
we knew an answer, we would have done no less than solve the problem
of induction (because we would know what procedures or forms of
organization are responsible for the success of science). Work on this
problem is an ongoing project, and so is the quest for understanding
scientific objectivity.</p>
