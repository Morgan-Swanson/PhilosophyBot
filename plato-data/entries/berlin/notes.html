<h2>Notes to <a href="index.html">Isaiah Berlin</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Late nineteenth-century German neo-Kantians had regarded philosophy
as the &lsquo;scientia scientiarum&rsquo;, the science of the
sciences. That is, science was concerned with enquiring into, and
establishing, how it is possible to know or understand anything else:
its goal was to understand understanding, to know what knowledge is
and how it can be achieved.</p></div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Berlin remained vague about where these concepts and categories came
from, and perhaps only once made at all explicit what the distinction
was between these two types of element in the structure of our
thought. Given his overall outlook, and hints scattered through his
writings, it seems likely that he believed they come mainly from
culture, education, ordinary experience and common social practices,
as well as philosophical theories. Some might be &lsquo;inbuilt&rsquo;
to the extent that they are influenced by certain basic needs or
tendencies intrinsic to human beings, or (like Kant&rsquo;s examples
of space and time) are required to make sense of the world and human
existence in ways comprehensible to our brains, given the manner in
which these are able to function. But Berlin believed that only a few
of the concepts and categories that we use are like this; many are
cultural or theoretical artefacts, subject to deliberate alteration or
change in response to experience. Examples of basic concepts that have
been transient include a teleological conception of nature&mdash;that
is, the view that everything that exists in the world exists for a
purpose, and is defined by the purpose that it pursues&mdash;and a
conception of human beings as wholly different from animals, as
opposed to a view that sees them as (particularly well-developed)
animals.</p>

<p>
As for the difference between concepts and categories, a passage in
<em>Historical Inevitability</em> (2002b, 144, note 1) appears to show
that categories (Berlin&rsquo;s examples here are &lsquo;the three
dimensions and infinite extent of ordinary perceptual space, the
irreversibility of temporal processes, the multiplicity and
countability of material objects&rsquo;) are more capacious,
unspecific and abstract than concepts. However, the boundary between
the two is left open, and it is unclear at what point it is crossed in
the sequence of increasingly specific and variable examples Berlin
gives: colours, shapes, (gustatory) tastes, &lsquo;the uniformities on
which the sciences are based&rsquo;, &lsquo;the categories of
value&rsquo;, &lsquo;moral standards&rsquo;, &lsquo;rules of
etiquette&rsquo;, subjective preferences of taste. Concepts are thus
perhaps related to categories somewhat as species to genus, though
Berlin does not put it in exactly these terms, and the evidence for
his view does not point to any precise, or consistent, position.</p>

<p>
Berlin did not offer a definitive statement or theory about concepts
and categories, not only because to do so involved doing the sort of
philosophical work from which he shrank, but also because he thought
that different concepts and categories differed in their origins,
function, necessity, malleability etc. For him, such concepts and
categories were simply facts about the way we think, which were
philosophically significant, but best approached in historical or
psychological terms, rather than as Kantian transcendental ideas (that
is, ideas which are wholly prior to experience, and are necessary
conditions for any kind of knowledge). </p></div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Berlin believed that philosophers make two kinds of contribution to
the consideration of philosophical questions. The first is to
reformulate these questions by suggesting a new outlook on the world
that liberates the intellect from the state of intellectual
quasi-cramp that has caused the problem. The second, critical rather
than creative, contribution is to provide a violent shock to dogmatic
assumptions about the solutions to philosophical questions, thus
creating new problems and inspiring further thought (1996, 59). For a
philosopher to do this required considerable force of character, and a
certain amount of exaggeration and simplification, as well as
self-confidence and persistence. Later in life Berlin described
himself as a historian of ideas rather than as a philosopher, despite
the fact that his account of the nature of philosophy emphasised
philosophy&rsquo;s historical dimension. This reflected his (high)
standards&mdash;which he did not believe himself to meet&mdash;for
considering someone a genuine or significant philosopher.</p></div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The topics that dominated Berlin&rsquo;s early work on philosophy
were the doctrines of verification and phenomenalism, derived from the
Vienna Circle by way of A. J. Ayer. In the 1930s Berlin and his
philosophical peers at Oxford were occupied primarily with the
philosophy of knowledge: How do, or can, we know things, and what does
it mean when we say we know something? They argued that these
questions were tied up with the use of language, and the evaluation of
the <em>meaning</em> of statements with questions such as &lsquo;How
do we know what a statement means, or if it has any meaning at
all?&rsquo; Verificationism held that the meaning of a statement was
to be found in the way in which it could be verified; if it
couldn&rsquo;t be verified&mdash;that is, shown to be true, or proven
false&mdash;it had no meaning as a statement of fact, but was merely
an expression of personal taste, or meaningless. Phenomenalism held
that all our knowledge comes from our sense impressions: we can know
only sense data, i.e. the deliverances of perceptual experience.
Anything not founded on sensory experience is nonsense.</p>

<p>
Berlin regarded these doctrines as beneficial in clearing away
confusions and exposing errors. But, while he believed that the world
of human experience is all that we can know, he rejected verifiability
as the only, or the most plausible, criterion for judging beliefs or
hypotheses, and maintained throughout his life that many statements
that could not be directly verified by empirical observation were
nevertheless clearly meaningful. He therefore warned his colleagues
that the principle of verification would lead to untenable
consequences, and would, if not abandoned or considerably revised,
breed new fallacies in the place of those it had dispelled. Berlin
argued that there are conceptual truths, such as relationships of
degree, similarity or contrast, which are universal, and which inform
our experience, but are not subject to empirical test. These
fundamental properties of qualities and relations are brute facts
which we cannot deny or think without, but which we can also not
verify by inspection.</p>

<p>
Berlin&rsquo;s approach in these early years was shaped by the
emphasis on the analysis of the meaning of words then being championed
by his friend J. L. Austin. As Berlin explained at the time,
&lsquo;Words are examined by philosophers for the purpose of
discovering whether, as they are used in successful communication,
they tend to exhibit or obscure some characteristic by which one type
of fact differs from another, or alternatively suggest falsely the
existence of distinctions which direct inspection of experience fails
to reveal. This is done because inattention to either tends to lead to
systematic confusion and error, not necessarily in the use of words,
which, being conventional and intended for common practice and not the
convenience of philosophers, is rightly not altered by their
criticisms, but in the accurate discrimination and description of
irreducible types of experience&rsquo; (1937, 100&ndash;2).</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 The term derives from the Ionian philosophers, the founders of
Western philosophy, such as Thales, who offered different theories
about the composition of the universe; a hallmark of these theories
was the attempt to discover a single substance out of which everything
else is composed.</p></div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The distinction between the human or cultural sciences&mdash;history,
philosophy, law and the various social sciences, such as sociology,
economics, anthropology etc.&mdash;had become a major issue in
nineteenth-century German philosophy. It continued to play an
important part in Germany in the earlier twentieth century, and also
became a significant issue in the English-speaking world, due both to
the influence of the Vienna Circle and to the emergence of the social
sciences as an increasingly self-confident and respected field of
study. Berlin&rsquo;s work, even though it invoked earlier figures
such as G. B. Vico and J. G. Herder, closely resembled, and was
influenced by, attempts by such thinkers as Heinrich Rickert, Wilhelm
Dilthey and Max Weber to explain the nature of the human sciences.</p></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Berlin acknowledged that there were certain human sciences that
sought to emulate the aims of the natural sciences, by trying to
discover regularities in human behaviour, and refining them into
explanatory laws. Berlin was dubious regarding such
disciplines&mdash;economics, sociology, psychology among
them&mdash;but acknowledged that such scientific studies of human
behaviour had some value. He maintained, though, that history remained
fundamentally different from the natural sciences in its aims and
techniques. Other human sciences may seek to abstract from a large
number of stable similarities and recurrences in human behaviour
across many different cases, in order to construct useful, applicable
ideal models to help better understand such behaviour. But history is
different: it is concerned with exploring and understanding individual
cases as individual, that is, unique, non-recurrent, changing and
unstable. It is richer in description and less rigorous in
explanation. Other human sciences necessarily abstract: their
descriptive power is extensive rather than intensive, their
descriptions thinner. The subject-matter of history, on the other
hand, involves a thick texture of criss-crossing, constantly changing
and melting conscious and unconscious beliefs and assumptions (1978b,
139). History is an &lsquo;amalgam, a rich brew composed of apparently
disparate ingredients&rsquo;. In looking for satisfactory and
satisfying historical accounts, we look for &lsquo;something full
enough and concrete enough to meet our conception of public life [...]
seen from as many points of view and at as many levels as possible,
including as many components, factors, aspects as the widest and
deepest knowledge, the greatest analytical power, insight, imagination
can present&rsquo;. Historical explanation is arrangement of the
discovered facts in patterns which satisfy us because they accord with
life&mdash;the variety of human experience and activity&mdash;as we
know it and can imagine it (1978b, 131&ndash;2). The historian seeks
to capture the unique pattern and peculiar characteristics of a
particular subject: to paint a portrait, rather than take an X-ray
image.</p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Berlin took up the problem of free will and determinism, and the
related topic of the role of individual choice and agency in history,
both indirectly, through an examination of Leo Tolstoy&rsquo;s
philosophy of history (originally published 1951, republished with
additions as <em>The Hedgehog and the Fox</em> 1953 and in 2008), and
in (<em>Historical Inevitability</em>, 1954; republished in 2002b).
These questions had, however, likely preoccupied him since his work on
Marx in the mid-1930s, when he would have encountered them in the form
of Plekhanov&rsquo;s defence of historical determinism.
Plekhanov&rsquo;s work served as a challenge to Berlin&rsquo;s belief
in the historical importance of individuals, and his conception of
morality, based as it was on the human capacity for choice.</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 The influence on Berlin of Soviet Communism is obvious here; but
while this was the main inspiration and target for his attack, his
critique could also be, and was, applied to Nazism, and even to the
more complacent and inhumane policies of capitalist Western
democracies.</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Apart from one essay on ancient Greek individualism (in 2002b), he
devoted scant attention to the history of the ideas in the ancient
world. As for the Middle Ages, while Berlin could admit that the
period might have been superior to what followed in some
respects&mdash;greater public order, intellectual security, social
cohesion etc.&mdash;he regarded it as by and large an intellectually
blank period, because of the very stability and conservatism of its
intellectual life. Berlin&rsquo;s interest in Renaissance thought was
greater, though it yielded only one essay &mdash; an original
examination of &lsquo;The Originality of Machiavelli&rsquo; (1972;
republished in Berlin 1979).</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Berlin&rsquo;s writings on the history of ideas can be classified in
several different ways. One is geographical, yielding as a first
category works on Russian intellectual and cultural history,
particularly of the nineteenth century; here belong his several essays
on Herzen, his two studies of Tolstoy, his pieces on Turgenev,
Belinsky and Plekhanov, as well as those on Russian populism and the
theme of artistic commitment in Russian thought (most of them included
in 2008). The other geographical category covers the history of ideas
in Western Europe, primarily focusing on Germany, but also
encompassing France and Italy (with glances at England and
Switzerland). (A third category may be made of Berlin&rsquo;s several
essays on modern, secular Jewish thinkers.) It is also natural to
divide his historical essays into portraits of individuals (in
addition to those already named, Vico, Herder, Hamann, Rousseau, Kant,
Maistre, Saint-Simon, Fichte, Hegel, Hess, Marx, Mill, Sorel, Verdi,
Meinecke and others) and examinations of larger epochs, movements and
themes&mdash;most notably the Enlightenment and the
Counter-Enlightenment, the romantic movement and nineteenth-century
socialism.</p></div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Berlin derived this interpretation of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s
assumptions and inconsistencies from Plekhanov&rsquo;s works on the
history of materialism.</p></div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Berlin focused, in his accounts of the Enlightenment, on the radical,
materialist, naturalist, proto-Utilitarian element among the
<em>philosophes</em> &mdash; Holbach, Helv&eacute;tius, La
Mettrie&mdash;and the more mild-mannered Condorcet, though he
acknowledged, and sought to encompass, other
figures&mdash;Montesquieu, Voltaire, Hume, Kant (the last two seen,
however, as forerunners of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s critics, however
unintentionally), and sometimes Rousseau.</p></div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 These included the ultramontane Catholic reactionary Joseph de
Maistre (whom he portrayed as a precursor of Fascism and the author of
a disturbingly compelling, dark and savage vision of human life as
essentially characterised by conflict); the Italian antiquarian and
critic of scientism Giambattista Vico; and pre-romantic German enemies
of Enlightenment rationalism and universalism such as Hamann and
Herder.</p></div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Berlin used the terms &lsquo;values&rsquo;, &lsquo;ideals&rsquo; and
&lsquo;goals&rsquo; more or less&mdash;but not
quite&mdash;interchangeably. Values, for Berlin, are ideas about what
it is good to be and do&mdash;about what sort of life, what sort of
character, what sort of actions, what state of being it is desirable
to aspire to.</p></div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Most prominent among these other pluralist thinkers have been Stuart
Hampshire, Bernard Williams, Michael Walzer, Thomas Nagel, John Gray,
Steven Lukes, John Kekes, Joseph Raz, William Galston and George
Crowder; Robert Nozick, John Rawls, Richard Rorty and Charles Taylor
have at times advanced positions which in some ways resemble
pluralism, but are difficult to categorise in relation to it.</p></div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Berlin did not respond to Leo Strauss&rsquo;s direct and powerful
attack; he did respond to Arnaldo Momigliano&rsquo;s criticism, which
made the pluralism = relativism accusation through an examination of
Berlin&rsquo;s interpretations of Vico and Herder; and he was anxious
to draw a sharp distinction between relativism and pluralism in his
later work. Nevertheless, the charge continues to be made by critics,
and rejected by supporters, of Berlin&rsquo;s pluralism.</p></div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 One of the best-known forms of relativism is cultural
relativism&mdash;the view that all values emerge from particular
cultures, and are valid within and for those cultures, but not
necessarily for others. Berlin sometimes appears to say this; he also
seems sometimes to endorse, and sometimes to disavow, a major
assumption underlying most versions of cultural relativism, namely, a
holistic conception of culture. This regards cultures as unified and
wholly separate entities, webs in which each belief is bound together
with every other belief, and within which members cannot disentangle
their beliefs one from another, rejecting some, retaining others,
judging each critically and separately. It remains controversial
whether Berlin&rsquo;s view of culture was holistic, and, if so, to
what extent and in what way; but it has been maintained&mdash;most
notably and persistently by Steven Lukes&mdash;that pluralism can be
rescued from the shoals of relativism if the pluralist rejects a
holistic conception of culture, which, Lukes maintains, is
fundamentally mistaken (Lukes 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001). Lukes&rsquo;s
critique of holism, and his de-coupling of pluralism from holism, are
plausible; it does not however necessarily follow that not accepting
holism allows the pluralist to believe consistently in universal
standards or values (conflicting though these may be) transcending all
cultures. The rejection of a holistic view of culture does remove a
major obstacle to a belief that certain values transcend cultural
differences, in suggesting that cultures aren&rsquo;t wholly
self-contained, closed-off and non-connecting. However, the occurrence
of variety, conflict and dissent within cultures, and the recurrence
of certain beliefs in different cultures, need not, in themselves,
suggest the existence of a universal human nature or universal values
underlying cultural variety.</p></div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Gray has sometimes presented his critique of liberalism as a critique
only of a certain sort of liberalism, or strain within the liberal
tradition, and has opposed to this another, better, more pluralistic
liberalism (see Gray 2002); at other times, he has presented his
critique as a more wholesale indictment of liberalism as such (see
e.g. Gray 1993, 1995, 1998).</p>

<p>
Gray&rsquo;s arguments can be summarised in vastly simplified form as
three main propositions about liberalism. The first of these is that
liberalism is absolutist and monistic: it is based on assigning an
absolute moral/political priority to liberty as the paramount
political value. If values really are incommensurable, then this is
unallowable. The second is that liberalism is one value-system or way
of life among many. If pluralism is conceived of in terms of ways of
life, value-systems, cultures etc., rather than individual values,
then the conclusion would be that liberalism is just one of these many
valid but conflicting ways of life, with no claim to privilege.
Therefore, liberals living in liberal societies are free to be liberal
and pursue liberal values; but they have no right to impose their
views on others, or regard themselves as superior or their way of
doing things as preferable. Finally, Gray charges that liberalism by
its nature has historically been a universalist doctrine&mdash;that
is, that it has denied this last proposition, and indeed claimed to be
superior to other forms of life, for all people, everywhere, at all
times. Therefore, if pluralism is accepted, and liberals accept
liberalism as just one form of life among many, then one of the
central goals of traditional liberalism must be abandoned.</p></div>

 Galston has argued that pluralism and liberalism are compatible if
neither is seen as a fully comprehensive or encompassing doctrine, and
has sought to suggest what a politics that is both truly pluralist and
truly liberal would look like. Crowder, in probably the most
systematic and careful discussion of the topic to date, has sought to
show that Gray&rsquo;s account of value pluralism incorporates a
number of assumptions and conclusions that make his position closer to
relativism than to a truly objective value pluralism; that genuine
value pluralism is wholly consistent with a belief in a core or
minimum of universal human values, as well as non-monistic and
non-quantitative comparison of and choice between values based on
practical reason; and that value-pluralism&rsquo;s recognition of both
genuine moral variety and a basic, minimal standard of human decency
support liberalism. Steven Lukes has also contributed much to this
debate, as have commentary by Hans Blokland (1999), Jeffrey Friedman
(1997), Amy Gutmann (1999), Ira Katznelson (1994), Charles Larmore
(1994), Pratap B. Mehta (1997), Jonathan Riley (2001 and 2002),
Michael Walzer (1995) and Daniel Weinstock (1997); there is also a
significant review of the topic by Albert Dzur (1998), and a
collection of essays exploring the political implications of pluralism
(Baghramian and Ingram, 2000). Whether these works&mdash;in
particular, Galston and Crowder&rsquo;s volumes&mdash;have exhausted
the pluralism/liberalism debate remains to be seen.</p></div>

 The insensitive and authoritarian rule of managerial
bureaucrats&mdash;those whom Stalin, in one of Berlin&rsquo;s
favourite quotations, called &lsquo;engineers of human
souls&rsquo;&mdash;particularly worried Berlin throughout the 1950s,
when most of his work on political judgement was written.</p></div>

 While Herzen&rsquo;s combination of ironic wit, moral passion and
vivacity naturally appealed to Berlin, it may seem strange that the
biddable British academic should have identified himself with the
wayward Russian aristocrat turned wandering revolutionary, or that the
very embodiment of cautious, sceptical and moderate liberalism should
have regarded a radical malcontent, the father of Russian agrarian
socialism, as a political guide.</p>

<p>
In fact, Herzen was an ambivalent revolutionary, and Berlin, while
certainly every inch the liberal, was a less stolid and more radical
thinker than is sometimes recognised. The two men shared a passion for
liberty, a suspicion of authority, an opposition to both injustice and
intellectual complacency. However, what Berlin seized on in Herzen was
the latter&rsquo;s opposition to &mdash; and occasional passionate
denunciation of&mdash; the doctrine of historical inevitability, and
the political ethics to which this attack was joined.</p></div>

 The distinction goes back at least to Kant, and it (or something like
it) had appeared in the works of T. H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet, and
Boris Chicherin, and had more recently been used by Guido de Ruggiero,
R. G. Collingwood, John Petrov Plamenatz, and Dorothy Fosdyke, among
others; Berlin himself acknowledged Benjamin Constant as the main
influence on his thinking. Berlin&rsquo;s conception of positive and
negative liberty may also owe something to Rousseau&rsquo;s
distinction between the liberty of the man and that of the citizen,
and to the more general distinction among earlier theorists, of whom
Rousseau was the most prominent, between natural and moral liberty.

 Berlin cites Stoicism&rsquo;s preaching of self-discipline and
renunciation as a way of resisting, and remaining uncorrupted by,
overwhelmingly powerful earthly authorities; Rousseau&rsquo;s
insistence that the only just society is one in which people retain
their liberty by transmuting it from the individual self-governance of
solitary selves in a state of nature to the collective self-rule of
the people by the people, so that obedience to the civil authority is
really obedience to oneself, and thus freedom rather than subjection;
and finally Kant&rsquo;s philosophy of moral autonomy, whereby the
individual&rsquo;s inalienable freedom and dignity lie in the fact
that the individual acts in accordance with a self-given moral law,
and is therefore recognised as a freely choice-making being, dependent
on no one and nothing else. Berlin has considerable sympathy for this
last, Kantian, outlook, though he believed that it had inspired
profound errors. He acknowledged that the Stoic ideal was admirable,
but charged that it rested on a misuse of words: to attain
independence through a renunciation of those desires that make one
prey to the domination of others might be sublime, and it might be the
best that one can do in certain circumstances; but the fact remains
that one is then less free than one would be otherwise, in that there
are constraints, both internal and, ultimately, external, preventing
one from acting with true freedom.</p></div>

 It must be noted that the former part of Berlin&rsquo;s argument here
is somewhat stronger than the latter: the conflict of values may mean
that the making of choices is an inescapable and even significant part
of life, but this is not, in itself, a reason for embracing the making
of choices as something valuable and central to both dignity and
fulfillment. Indeed, if making choices involves the tragic losses that
Berlin claims it sometimes does, one may be inclined to try to escape
the painful and difficult position of having to choose, rather than
proudly embracing it.</p></div>

 Berlin&rsquo;s Zionism has been the subject of minor controversy.
Some critics have complained that it led him to turn a blind eye to
injustice and tacitly approve of Israeli chauvinism. This was not so.
Berlin was a liberal and humane Zionist; he believed in the justice
and necessity of a Jewish homeland, but also opposed violence,
nationalist aggression and chauvinism wherever they appeared. Indeed,
his aversion to political radicalism led him to support the moderate,
pro-British Chaim Weizmann against more assertive Zionist leaders such
as David Ben-Gurion in the 1940s, even when it became apparent that
Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s strategy was likely to be more effective than
Weizmann&rsquo;s in establishing a Jewish state. Later in life Berlin
was a quiet but firm, and at times privately vehement, critic of the
Likud bloc and of Israeli policy in the West Bank and Gaza, and a
supporter of the Peace Now movement and a &lsquo;two-state
solution&rsquo; to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (see
